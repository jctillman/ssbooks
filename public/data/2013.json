And once you have your minimally-trained crossbowmen, you then need to invest a few more hours of square-bashing to get them to move as a co-ordinated unit, follow simple orders, and not shoot each other in the face.  You may not need 10,000 hours of training, but you need (even in modern day armies) a minimum of six weeks&#x2019; training to turn your herdsmen, ploughboys and fisher lads into something resembling soldiers.</p>\n<p>Also, pikes against cavalry stops being effective when the knights dump the armour and start using guns themselves.  </p>\n<p>&#x201C;only the richest of the rich could even own their own Bible&#x201D;</p>\n<p>I recommend to you Eamonn Duffy&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Marking-Hours-English-Prayers-1240-1570/dp/0300170580\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marking the Hours</a> to see why this is a bit more complicated than just &#x201C;Translate the Bible into English/German/Polynesian, print up x thousand copies, and away you go!&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Sure, only the very rich had things like the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tr%C3%A8s_Riches_Heures_du_Duc_de_Berry\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tr&#xE8;s Riches Heures </a>, but the aspiring middle classes could have their own personal missals, and even a peasant could afford tuppence for a holy picture or pilgrimage medal.

Unstructured interactions with strangers are in general liable to be degrading and uncomfortable for women.

In modern Western society, it seems to be rational for men to defect; hence the PUA movement.
