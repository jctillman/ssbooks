And why should they? Professors don&#x2019;t benefit if their students learn more (they benefit from offering easy classes because that gets them good reviews [<a href=\"http://smile.amazon.com/Academically-Adrift-Limited-Learning-Campuses/dp/0226028569?sa-no-redirect=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">1</a>]). Students don&#x2019;t benefit from institutions where they learn more (they benefit from high grades at high-reputation institutions. If an institution could quadruple the rate at which student learning happened for a 1% increase in student effort, the typical grade-optimizing student wouldn&#x2019;t be against it, because quadruple the material means quadruple the amount on the test, so they&#x2019;re expending 1% more effort for the same grade. See also: students who celebrate when class is canceled.) College administrators certainly aren&#x2019;t optimizing for learning (they benefit from an institution that&#x2019;s perceived as more elite, which has little to do with learning, because otherwise elite universities would be unusually good at teaching. I have a friend at Harvard who does well in classes where he&#x2019;s learned nothing. Also, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuY7szYSXSw\" rel=\"nofollow\">this guy</a>. Also, <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/08/certified-teach.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a></p>\n<p>-A lot of the psychological research which impinges on learning is fairly recent (past 60 years or so; see, for instance, the list of citations <a href=\"http://www.gwern.net/Spaced%20repetition\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>), and hasn&#x2019;t managed to work it&#x2019;s way into education systems that do very little to optimize for learning.</p>\n<p>-That style of teaching <i>is</i> disappearing, albeit slowly. See, for instance, App Academy, Rob Rhineheart learning biochemistry fairly quickly, Eliezer Yudkowsky doing mathematical research without so much as a GRE, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duolingo#Duolingo_for_Schools\" rel=\"nofollow\">Duolingo being incorporated into shools</a>. It&#x2019;s happening slowly, and almost entirely outside of the traditional systems (K&#x2013;12, college), but it&#x2019;s there.</p>\n<p>-Organizational inertia. Combination of &#x201C;this was how the last generation learned it, it worked, why are we changing?&#x201D; and &#x201C;I [the professor] am the best in the world at X, this is how I learned X, therefore it&#x2019;s the best way to learn X&#x201D; and even &#x201C;I&#x2019;m the best in the world at X and I learned it successfully this way, therefore everyone else should be able to learn it this way.&#x201D; (It really hasn&#x2019;t helped that most of the relevant research has been done sometime between when current professors took the classes they&#x2019;re teaching and are teaching the classes they&#x2019;re teaching.)</p>\n<p>-Getting good at learning is seen as low status. There was an Overcoming Bias post the this effect that I can&#x2019;t find, but the overwhelming attitude I&#x2019;ve encountered is that, if you&#x2019;re actually smart, then you don&#x2019;t need to optimize your learning strategies, so looking into how to be a more effective learning is a tacit admission that you&#x2019;re not actually smart (to the point that students will brag about how little they studied, because getting a B with no work means you&#x2019;re smarter than someone who got an A with a lot of work.) Thus, universities don&#x2019;t reward professors for looking to become better teachers, and, to some degree, even punish them; my sister had a really great physics professor who was denied tenure for so long he left his position because he was studying physics education (low status) rather than physics (high status).</p>\n<p>In summary: Textbooks are better than lecture for learning, but schools still utilize lecture because they have little incentive to make more learning happen. Alternatives that produce better outcomes have been identified and are starting to displace traditional education, but the research leading to them is recent enough we haven&#x2019;t seen this happen to any significant degree&#x2026; yet. However, ceter paribus, a student who&#x2019;s successfully learned stuff is going to outcompete a student who hasn&#x2019;t, so traditional institutions will eventually either adapt or die.</p>\n<p>Suntzuanime also makes a good point.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T16:24:38.407Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T16:24:39.029Z","PageId":416}},{"id":111,"mentionDate":"1422448020000","createdAt":"2017-05-06T18:09:50.513Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T18:09:50.513Z","BookId":50,"CommentId":263860,"Comment":{"id":263860,"commentUrl":"http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/27/ot13-thread-the-blood-of-angry-men/","commentId":"comment-177941","commentTimestamp":"1422448020000","commentAuthor":"zz","commentHtml":"<p>School choice is hard to measure because there&#x2019;s no obvious metric.

For examples, in the 1960s one study of over 100 alcoholics found that half of the high-dose LSD treatment participants reported abstinence 6 months after treatment, in comparison with one-third of those in a low-dose LSD group and only 12% in a conventionally treated group. Other research in the 1960s indicated that a majority of cancer patients suffering from anxiety, depression, and uncontrollable pain showed improvement in their physical and emotional status after LSD treatment. The researchers also observed that many of these LSD-treated patients reported that their desire for addictive pain medicines, such as morphine, diminished or vanished, along with the pain. In fact, at that time the National Institute of Mental Health recognized that the use of LSD in these types of patients was legitimate.</p>\n<p>This LSD therapy phase began to wane in the mid-1960s for two primary reasons. First, the psychiatric community was unable to decide how LSD should be used in the therapeutic process or to document its efficacy scientifically. Second, but the mid-1960s, nonmedical use of LSD, especially by young people comprising a counterculture that was opposed to traditional values (&#x201C;hippies&#x201D;), led to the belief that LSD had become a public health problem. As a result the U.S. government passed a law that banned the use and sale of LSD, as well as peyote, mescaline, and several similar drugs, by the public. At that point, legitimate research on its effects on humans and on its potential therapeutic uses declined precipitously&#x2014;not only because of the legal difficulties and maze of bureaucratic procedures required, but also because psychedelic research with humans was not viewed as reputable by the vast majority of those in the scientific community.</p>\n<p>In this third phase, LSD and similar drugs became just another class of abusable drugs that mainstream culture attempted to suppress. Psychedelic drug therapy still goes on unofficially&#x2014;practitioners would not continue using it under difficult conditions unless they believed that they were accomplishing something.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T16:24:15.144Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T16:24:15.793Z","PageId":410}}],"mentionCount":2},{"id":155,"title":"Food and Western Disease: Health and Nutrition from an Evolutionary Perspective","author":"Stefan Lindeberg","amazonLink":"1405197714","amazonLinkImage":null,"createdAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.625Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.625Z","Mentions":[{"id":177,"mentionDate":"1433064000000","createdAt":"2017-05-06T18:13:28.366Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T18:13:28.366Z","BookId":155,"CommentId":237391,"Comment":{"id":237391,"commentUrl":"http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/05/30/that-chocolate-study/","commentId":"comment-207132","commentTimestamp":"1433064000000","commentAuthor":"zz","commentHtml":"<p>Obligatory <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/882/\" rel=\"nofollow\">xkcd</a> is obligatory.</p>\n<blockquote cite=\"\"><p>Nutrition isn&#x2019;t a real science and we should all just be in a state of radical skepticism about these things</p></blockquote>\n<p>If anyone shares this opinion, I invite you to read <a href=\"http://smile.amazon.com/Food-Western-Disease-Evolutionary-Perspective/dp/1405197714\" rel=\"nofollow\">Food and Western Disease</a>.

I&#x2019;m going to try to answer some of your questions:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Furthermore every single hypothesis I have seen advanced by feminists to explain the STEM sex gap (and in truth virtually every sex gap) seems to paint a picture of women that is &#x2026; that women are weak, timid, easily influenced, do not know their own minds and can not be trusted to make their own decisions.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I think you&#x2019;re reading something into these arguments that isn&#x2019;t there &#x2014; that the theories implicit in the arguments are only supposed to apply to women.  I believe that the perspective is actually that men and women are similarly weak, timid, easily influenced, etc. but that due to prevailing cultural attitudes, men are &#x201C;easily influenced&#x201D; into more active, heroic roles and women are &#x201C;easily influenced&#x201D; into passive, support-type roles.  The problem may be that you don&#x2019;t realize that, to most of the people making these arguments, culture is supposed to be a much stronger force in shaping one&#x2019;s preferences than anything intrinsic to the individual.</p>\n<p>That is, the &#x201C;feminist&#x201D; theory here is that women have different outcomes (including different preferences) because they are socialized differently than men are.  On this theory, women must be protected from memetic harm.  Men don&#x2019;t need this protection not because they are stronger than or less easily influenced than women, but because their socialization is presumed by the feminist not to be harmful.</p>\n<p>Note, I am not making any judgment here about whether any parts of the implicit theory are true or not.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Whats more is that this seems to be a trend. Whether its the &#x201C;anti-manspreading&#x201D; campaign, the &#x201C;anti-street harassment&#x201D; campaign, the campaign to &#x201C;nudge&#x201D; women into STEM subjects, the refusal to consider women&#x2019;s aggregate choices in employment as it pertains to the &#x201C;wage gap&#x201D;, or the unequal treatment of males and females regarding alcohol and its effect on sexual consent, the underlying message seems to be that women are fragile, weak willed, victims who can not be trusted to make their own decisions or bear responsibility for their own choices.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Assuming you meant, &#x201C;anti-mansplaining&#x201D;.  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Men-Explain-Things-Rebecca-Solnit/dp/1608463869\" rel=\"nofollow\">This</a> book was written before the author had heard of the term &#x201C;mansplaining&#x201D; (and in a forward written for a later edition the author mentions not thinking the term especially helpful).  Anecdotally (and since you feel free to draw on experience to support most of your claims, I feel fine doing the same) it really does seem as though there&#x2019;s a tendency for at least some men to underestimate the intellectual abilities and accomplishments of women.  <em>To the extent that this is a real phenomenon, it seems valid to me to raise awareness of it and to try to discourage it.</em>  Without a valid argument as to why I shouldn&#x2019;t believe &#x201C;mansplaining&#x201D; is a real phenomenon <em>or</em> why it would be desirable for women&#x2019;s intellect to be underestimated, I&#x2019;m stuck with the impression that this is actually a legitimate feminist complaint.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;anti-street harassment&#x201D; &#x2014; A lot of women have an open stated preference that fewer men catcall, flirt with, or generally express opinions on their appearance in public.  (I&#x2019;ll appeal to your obvious concern with women&#x2019;s preferences to make sense of why this is significant.)  Again anecdotally, it seems safe to me to say that most of the men engaged in this behavior don&#x2019;t do so as a result of unassailable motives.  Applying social pressure (mostly shame since that&#x2019;s the main vector for social pressure) to try to achieve one&#x2019;s open stated preferences seems legitimate to me.  It&#x2019;s the same way we keep people from cutting in line or from taking all the donuts from the break room.  If there was a legitimate argument that the sorts of behaviors being discouraged are actually useful to society in some important way I&#x2019;d love to hear it. </p>\n<p>the campaign to &#x201C;nudge&#x201D; women into STEM subjects &#x2013; Again, I don&#x2019;t think this is done with the intention of denying women their preferences.  I think it&#x2019;s done from the perspective that those preferences are primarily the result of socialization and that different sorts of socialization would give different preferences.  Feminists perceive our culture as steering young women away from <em>interest</em> in STEM  subjects and want our culture not to do that any more.  Feminists aren&#x2019;t saying young women <em>must</em> study STEM subjects.  They&#x2019;re saying they should be able to if they want to and they shouldn&#x2019;t have to contend with anti-woman bias in addition to the challenge of STEM material itself if they so choose.</p>\n<p>Feminists may be factually mistaken as to whether this is actually a good description of the state of affairs, but whether they&#x2019;re factually wrong says pretty much nothing about their motives which I think are much different than you believe them to be.  Since the feminist approach relies on assumptions that need to be empirically validated (and probably won&#x2019;t be) I won&#x2019;t argue as I did with your first two examples that this is a legitimate practice; still, I believe it&#x2019;s helpful to try to understand the perspective of the person against whose position you are arguing.</p>\n<p>refusal to to consider women&#x2019;s aggregate choices &#x2014; this is in some sense simpler than the other cases and in some sense more complex.  The more complex way of looking at this is that, as above, those choices and preferences are (under a feminist&#x2019;s way of seeing the world) at least in part the result of a process of socialization &#x2014; if the woman had been raised differently she would have different choices and preferences.  Feminists want to create a cultural environment in which women&#x2019;s preferences aren&#x2019;t constrained in the ways feminists currently perceive them to be.  (Again, they may be factually mistaken but that won&#x2019;t tell us much about their motives.)  So it&#x2019;s not that they&#x2019;re ignoring the content of women&#x2019;s preferences, it&#x2019;s that the content of those preferences is itself the issue under discussion from the perspective of a feminist.</p>\n<p>The simpler way to see this one is an instance of &#x201C;all arguments are soldiers.&#x201D;  If feminists admit that the pay gap is the result of preferences (actually, they usually do admit this and then argue that the preferences themselves are a result of a sexist culture), then they have lost what looks like a pretty good argument for affirmative action for women.</p>\n<p>the unequal treatment of males and females regarding alcohol and its effect on sexual consent &#x2013; Most feminists I&#x2019;ve seen writing on this topic will say that the rules are the same in both cases &#x2014; whether it&#x2019;s a woman or a man who is intoxicated, the result is still rape.  (I suspect there are plenty of feminists who think that men cannot be raped by definitional fiat.  Let&#x2019;s ignore the complete idiots on both sides.)  I think most feminists would argue that where such an inequality is perceived, that inequality actually results from unequal sexual aggression between men and women &#x2014; men may be more likely to proceed in cases that are ethically ambiguous. </p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s only the last couple paragraphs of your comment I take any issue with, and even then it&#x2019;s <em>mostly</em> just the fact that you seem to want to make a moral case against your opponents by (accidentally, it seems) misrepresenting their motives.  Try to avoid this &#x2014; it makes the argument you started out with look weaker than it really is.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T16:24:55.410Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T16:24:56.231Z","PageId":419}}],"mentionCount":1},{"id":78,"title":"Principles of Microeconomics","author":"James Miller","amazonLink":"B00N4GQUGA","amazonLinkImage":null,"createdAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.607Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.607Z","Mentions":[{"id":267,"mentionDate":"1447091820000","createdAt":"2017-05-06T18:30:39.839Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T18:30:39.839Z","BookId":78,"CommentId":191687,"Comment":{"id":191687,"commentUrl":"http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/11/08/ot33-opeth-thread/","commentId":"comment-261009","commentTimestamp":"1447091820000","commentAuthor":"James D.

Because it appeals to our &#x201C;common sense.&#x201D; When a new argument beats an old argument it is because the new argument is more intuitively obvious than the old one. Huemer&#x2019;s book shows how our uncontroversial moral intuitions, applied consistently, show that the state is immoral. The only way an immoral entity can be allowed to exist is if there is no better alternative.</p>\n<p>So, if anarcho capitalism can work, it is more morally correct.</p>\n<p>The reason it hasn&#x2019;t happened yet is the same reason democracy didn&#x2019;t occur everywhere throughout time and still is dysfunctional many places. We improve our moral intuitions over time. Democracy is an improvement over totalitarianism. We should see greater moral improvements lead to a more libertarian, and eventually anarcho-capitalist, society.</p>\n<p>So critics are right when they say it wouldn&#x2019;t work yet, and it&#x2019;s because people <em>expect</em> it not to work. A new government would replace the old tomorrow. But expectations change over time. There was a time it would be considered crazy for a leader of a country to give up power peacefully, once obtained. Now it would be crazy for, say, a US president <em>not</em> to give up power.</p>\n<p>Even though it likely wouldn&#x2019;t work now doesn&#x2019;t mean it&#x2019;s not right to hold the views of anarcho-capitalism. One holds and first argues for the correct answer, then one can move on to more &#x201C;utilitarian&#x201D; solutions and compromise in the meantime. All we can do is push the ball towards the ultimate moral goal as best we can since people take a long time to be convinced.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T16:23:08.398Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T16:23:09.093Z","PageId":390}}],"mentionCount":1},{"id":183,"title":"The Uniqueness of Western Civilization","author":"Ricardo Duchesne","amazonLink":"9004232761","amazonLinkImage":null,"createdAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.627Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.627Z","Mentions":[{"id":268,"mentionDate":"1447065240000","createdAt":"2017-05-06T18:30:39.841Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T18:30:39.841Z","BookId":183,"CommentId":191671,"Comment":{"id":191671,"commentUrl":"http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/11/08/ot33-opeth-thread/","commentId":"comment-260645","commentTimestamp":"1447065240000","commentAuthor":"JK","commentHtml":"<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Uniqueness-Civilization-Critical-Sciences-Academic/dp/9004232761/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Uniqueness of Western Civilization</a> by Ricardo Duchesne.

The usual distinction is that <i>sung</i> doesn&#x2019;t mean like an overcooked noodle, it means like a cat watching a mousehole. The fact that English doesn&#x2019;t have a word for the latter concept is probably a serious gap in our view of the world&#x2013; our model marks too much effort (and valorizes it) and too little effort, while leaving optimal effort out of the picture.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Secrets-Pelvis-Martial-Arts-Practical-ebook/dp/B00C14WO5W\" rel=\"nofollow\">Secrets of the Pelvis for the Martial Arts</a> has an appendix about the connotations of &#x201C;round&#x201D; in Chinese.

In American English, &#x201C;round&#x201D; has a range of meanings, but none of them have so much metaphysical force.</p>\n<p>The next is from memory of an article in Tai Chi magazine about a word which means resist without effort, like a wall standing in the wind.

Other thoughts:</p>\n<blockquote cite=\"\"><p>3.

Tempo of individual performance trials was varied systematically; logically understandable changes in tempo occurred between trials (e.g. slowed things down to get tricky sections correct).<br>\n8. Target passages were repeated until the error was corrected and the passage was stabilized, as evidenced by the error&#x2019;s absence in subsequent trials.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The article claims that the top three pianists used all these strategies and all the lesser pianists barely utilized them. I find this both surprising, because every single student-musician who was serious about music uses them, and not surprising, because everyone I know who&#x2019;s serious uses these strategies; if you&#x2019;re not using them, no wonder you&#x2019;re not in the top.</p>\n<p>Then again, I live in an unusually good musical community. My friend is son of a professional conductor, has played Yo-Yo Ma&#x2019;s cello several times, and has studied under the best teachers in the world the country&#x2019;s best music programs. I have a fraction of his talent, growing-up-in-a-musical-household, and practice regimen, and I&#x2019;ve still been able to work with members of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_%28orchestras%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Philadelphia Orchestra</a>.</p>\n<p>Notice how close Texas (where the study in question was conducted) is to any of the Big Five orchestras. It&#x2019;s <i>extremely</i> plausible that the study subjects&#x2014;advanced undergraduate and graduate piano and piano pedagogy majors&#x2014;are genuinely unaware of the best practice strategies that are completely obvious to someone relatively talentless like me because they don&#x2019;t come from a culture that supports it*.</p>\n<p>There&#x2019;s probably a pre-selection effect here: if you&#x2019;re a music student and know how to practice effectively, you probably aren&#x2019;t going to school in Texas, and if you&#x2019;re a good music teacher and keep up with what works the best and are good at changing your mind in response to new evidence and maybe even read some cog psy literature, you probably aren&#x2019;t teaching in Texas.</p>\n<p>&#x2014;-</p>\n<p>*If you doubt that different regional cultures can have such drastic effects, just look briefly at how entirely Korea dominates The Rest of the World in Starcraft 2. I can&#x2019;t dig up a really great primary reference, but Koreans are so much better than &#x201C;foreigners&#x201D; (as they&#x2019;re called) that there&#x2019;s essentially two leagues: one for Koreans and one for everyone else, so they aren&#x2019;t beaten by Koreans. It&#x2019;s a bit like men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s leagues in physical sports: the best non-Koreans can maybe compete with second-string Koreans, but it&#x2019;s truly remarkable/unheard of for a foreigner to beat an A-team Korean. For instance, <a href=\"http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/Hydra\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hydra</a>, a Korean progamer somewhere between A- and B-team, was <a href=\"http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/2015_WCS_Season_1/Premier\" rel=\"nofollow\">recently defeated</a> by a foreigner, after going something like 60-0 against foreigners.</p>\n<p>&#x2026;There&#x2019;s a point here, and it&#x2019;s that Koreans beat the snot out of non-Koreans and that the best explanation is Korean culture: they treat the best Starcraft players like Americans treat the best baseballers (in all honesty, they inspire more awe&#x2014;when was the last time a baseballer was <a href=\"http://www.teamliquid.net/staff/Waxangel/jinairplane.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">painted on an airplane</a>?), and they&#x2019;ve figured out how to practice Starcraft most effectively. Foreigners don&#x2019;t the same coaching quality, high-level practice partners, or practice regimen, and thus get the snot beat out of them.</p>\n<p>So, yes: if a game like Starcraft, which is inherently internet-centric, can have the best players in different regions doing different things because of cultural differences, then we shouldn&#x2019;t be surprised to see something similar in classical music, which doesn&#x2019;t mesh well with the internet.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T16:23:19.962Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T16:23:20.983Z","PageId":393}}],"mentionCount":1},{"id":361,"title":"Mindset: The New Psychology of Success","author":"Carol S.

The feeling that you can always eke out more with the right inducement is an illusion. Eventually one more straw will in fact break a camel&#x2019;s back. As for willpower&#x2026; With the right inducement (say, continued employment) you can exert superhuman willpower, like waking up early and going to work every day for years or decades. Which is to say that with the right incentives, willpower doesn&#x2019;t even need to be invoked. So maybe I&#x2019;m saying that it doesn&#x2019;t matter if willpower is unlimited, you can route around it and find creative ways to induce yourself to do what you really want to do.</p>\n<p>Dammit, I degenerated immediately to pitching Beeminder again!</p>\n<p>But to finish the thought, as I&#x2019;ve argued in the comments above, the best way to use Beeminder, at least initially, is not to probe the hard limits of willpower but to fix egregious instances of akrasia &#x2014; to do a bit more than the bupkes you&#x2019;d do if left to your own devices. You can then gradually dial up the steepness of your graph, but certainly stop doing that before feeling overwhelmed by stress and anxiety.</p>\n<p>In other words, make a measurable improvement well below the point that the limits of willpower are even a question (if you don&#x2019;t think of it as routing around willpower altogether). Some people &#x2014; like the productivity-ueber-alles types who try polyphasic sleep and whatnot &#x2014; thrive on adding stress and Beeminder can accommodate that. But using it in moderation can reduce stress, like by getting you to spread your studying out over a semester instead of cramming for exams, or by making you pay attention to your fitbit just enough to actually get in 10k steps a day, or getting yourself to bed on time instead of repeatedly getting in &#x201C;one more point&#x201D; in a comment thread till 2am.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T16:23:22.956Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T16:23:23.128Z","PageId":394}}],"mentionCount":1},{"id":26,"title":"The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion","author":"Jonathan Haidt","amazonLink":"0307455777","amazonLinkImage":null,"createdAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.600Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.600Z","Mentions":[{"id":315,"mentionDate":"1433344440000","createdAt":"2017-05-06T18:51:08.205Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T18:51:08.205Z","BookId":26,"CommentId":237259,"Comment":{"id":237259,"commentUrl":"http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/06/01/ot21-master-and-commenter/","commentId":"comment-208299","commentTimestamp":"1433344440000","commentAuthor":"Anthony","commentHtml":"<p>Mood stabilizers are known to suppress emotions generally, but I have no idea if this makes people more rational.

If all other bundles available to Bob given his constraints are negative utility&#x2014;that is, of lower utility than the suicide bundle&#x2014;then what we expect Bob to choose the bundle of highest available to him, which is the suicide bundle. We don&#x2019;t observe this, so we conclude there is some bundle available to Bob of higher utility than the suicide bundle&#x2014;that is, our observation of lack of widespread suicide among Africans implies that their lives have positive value.</p>\n<p>(This is basically the argument that David Friedman makes below.

I always found faith in the invisible hand of free market capitalism to cure all human ills to be a bit too much like faith in the invisible sky god, and faith in &#x201C;science&#x201D; is right up there.  I have faith that, in the long run, science will probably get closer to reflecting how the universe actually works, but not in any particular current paradigm.  Skepticism is a virtue in science.

For better or worse, modern software engineering is less &#x201C;come up with clever algorithms&#x201D; and is more &#x201C;string together frameworks to solve your problem&#x201D;. </p>\n<p>(3) Learn how to engineer software.
