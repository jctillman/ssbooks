Ony clearly expresses a preference for smaller countries.  And I think Tibor has said the same. I don&#x2019;t think anyone has said that big countries are usually governed better. I would like to see some discussion on whether or not Ony and Tibor are correct.</p>\n<p>Intuitively I tend to agree that smaller countries are better. In my book &#x201C;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Simplify-Government-Mark-Anderson-ebook/dp/B01GLQACCW/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1469241098&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=simplify+government#navbar\" rel=\"nofollow\">Simplify Government</a>,&#x201D; I argue that more complex government leads to less efficient and effective outcomes. And I think that smaller countries are almost certain to have simpler governments than larger ones, so in that respect I think smaller countries would likely govern more effectively and be more accountable to its citizenry. The counter-point to this are the many complicated and dysfunctional state and local governments that exist now in the US. Would these governments run better if the Federal government wasn&#x2019;t a distraction to citizens?</p>\n<p>And I see strong reasons for favoring large countries.  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_European_Union\" rel=\"nofollow\">The EU began</a> as a way to avoid future European wars by uniting previous warring countries into one confederation (with some large country like features). And it has been extra-ordinarily successful at that &#x2013; I think it is unimaginable today that any of the EU countries today would declare war on another one, any more than Kentucky would declare war on Ohio. And I think part of the rationale of the EU was also to try to duplicate the economic advantages of the single market that exists in the US. And I think the EU has been successful there too, with borders becoming much less significant than they were. And despite all the Euro bashing that has occurred over the last ten years or so, it seems to me that a single currency has also been very effective in simplifying lives of people traveling between countries or doing business with each other. Admittedly I have little direct knowledge of the impact, having never even been to Euro-land. But from my distant perspective it appears to be a great thing to have a single currency and many unifying laws across the EU.</p>\n<p>And I do find it difficult to imagine life in the US if it was broken up into many smaller countries. I can now drive for thousands of miles across the country without encountering a single government official questioning why I am traveling or where I am going. I can move to anywhere else in the country and get a job and live there as easily as my own location. Of course I would have to follow their local laws and customs, which might be different from my current location, but still under the US constitution and laws.  There is a lot of freedom in having a large country available for travel and living and commerce without substantial borders between different locations.</p>\n<p>Does anyone know of empirical research on the advantages or disadvantages of large countries vs small ones? Like perhaps how do large vs small correlate with the rankings of countries in Freedom House or other types of rankings?</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T15:51:08.157Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T15:51:08.567Z","PageId":39}}],"mentionCount":1},{"id":139,"title":"The Confessions of St. Augustine","author":"Augustine","amazonLink":"0800787625","amazonLinkImage":null,"createdAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.614Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.614Z","Mentions":[{"id":38,"mentionDate":"1491335820000","createdAt":"2017-05-06T18:08:08.442Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T18:08:08.442Z","BookId":139,"CommentId":12794,"Comment":{"id":12794,"commentUrl":"http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/04/02/open-thread-72-5/","commentId":"comment-483530","commentTimestamp":"1491335820000","commentAuthor":"<a href=\"http://jaskology.com/\" rel=\"external nofollow\" class=\"url\">Jaskologist</a>","commentHtml":"<p>That&#x2019;s enough for me!

He uses a couple analogies of other prospective consent. The first is from classical literature &#x2013; Ulysses tied to the mast. He prospectively ceded his negative bodily autonomy, that is, he gave others the right to decide at a later date what he could <i>not</i> do. Normally, tying someone up like that and refusing to let them go might be some form of kidnapping, but his prospective consent could provide a defense for such a charge.</p>\n<p>The second example I recall him using was skydiving. Suppose a person had gone up in an airplane a few times, each time chickening out at the moment of the jump, and returning to the ground inside the plane. Finally, she tells the instructor, &#x201C;No matter what I say when I&#x2019;m up there, I want you to throw me out of the plane.&#x201D; Normally, throwing someone out of plane would be some form of assault, but we are likely to accept her prospective consent, ceding her positive autonomy to perform the jump and providing a defense to such a charge for the instructor.</p>\n<p>He gave a few factors from these examples (and others that I don&#x2019;t recall offhand) that would make us more/less likely to accept prospective consent, but I see very little reason to draw a bright line around the category of sexual activities in order to make it uniquely immune. The easier case is prospective consent to cede negative sexual autonomy &#x2013; &#x201C;You&#x2019;re my friends, girls. No matter what I say later tonight, don&#x2019;t let me go home with <i>him</i> again.&#x201D; We get closer to politicized shouting as we move toward prospective consent to cede positive autonomy.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T15:54:26.567Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T15:54:27.517Z","PageId":83}}],"mentionCount":1},{"id":204,"title":"Alastor","author":"Jack Vance","amazonLink":"0312869525","amazonLinkImage":null,"createdAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.629Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.629Z","Mentions":[{"id":86,"mentionDate":"1485535080000","createdAt":"2017-05-06T18:09:02.462Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T18:09:02.462Z","BookId":204,"CommentId":36837,"Comment":{"id":36837,"commentUrl":"http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/01/26/open-thread-67-75/","commentId":"comment-458583","commentTimestamp":"1485535080000","commentAuthor":"Cerebral Paul Z.","commentHtml":"<p>Those interested in LeGuin&#x2019;s anarchist society might get a kick out of Jack Vance&#x2019;s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Alastor-Jack-Vance/dp/0312869525/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1485534943&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=alastor\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wyst: Alastor 1716</a>, which contains a cruelly accurate parody of it.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T15:53:14.869Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T15:53:15.485Z","PageId":67}}],"mentionCount":1},{"id":224,"title":"The Rational Peasant: The Political Economy of Rural Society in Vietnam","author":"Samuel L.
