Soviet tank production explodes in 1942. Was the US providing much in the way of supply before the end of that year?</p>\n<p>First, the specifics of the timeline matter.   Lend lease is passed in March, initially does not apply to the USSR.  the germans invade at the end of june.  lend lease aid officially begins in october.  So, already, aid in 1941 is limited, and on top of that, much of soviet industry spent the latter half of 1941 being evacuated eastwards.  Much of the early aid also was taken up more in the form of finished goods that were immediately thrown into the fight.  in 42, once the factories are running again, the soviets request more raw material aid.</p>\n<p>&gt;I wonder if there is a specialist history on this topic &#x2013; it would probably require a lot of knowledge of manufacturing, manufacturing history, etc to be able to discuss it really well. I think it is extremely likely that the relatively large number of different models and variants the Germans had didn&#x2019;t help them, but I don&#x2019;t have any hard facts.</p>\n<p>The official book is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Wages-Destruction-Making-Breaking-Economy/dp/0143113208\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wages of Destruction</a>.  It&#x2019;s an extremely fantastic book.  I think it&#x2019;s actually better at the pre-war and early war than the Speer Era, but when I say that I&#x2019;m doing whatever the opposite of damning with faint praise is (praising with faint damnation?).  It very concretely demonstrates that Speer&#x2019;s armaments miracle was largely not of his making, and shows the extent to which the german war economy was limited by hard resource constraints.</p>\n<p>The germans definitely would have been better off with certain economies, and suffered from far too many models of certain vehicles and aircraft which dissipated their engineering capacity and complicated their logistical chains.  That said, you can&#x2019;t just assume that a winnowing down would have selected the right models.   the story of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StG_44\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sturmgewehr </a> is illustrative.  At the end of the day, though, it simply didn&#x2019;t matter.  Replace every single german tank with a Tiger, every me 109 with an me 262 and the germans still lose.  It takes longer, and more allies die, but once germany is at war with the brits, americans and russians, they can&#x2019;t win.   All they could do was ensure that little boy dropped on berlin, not hiroshima.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T15:59:47.790Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T15:59:48.470Z","PageId":145}},{"id":62,"mentionDate":"1482086880000","createdAt":"2017-05-06T18:08:25.900Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T18:08:25.900Z","BookId":409,"CommentId":49282,"Comment":{"id":49282,"commentUrl":"http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/12/17/ot65-the-early-thread-gets-the-worm/","commentId":"comment-445371","commentTimestamp":"1482086880000","commentAuthor":"cassander","commentHtml":"<p>Deluge by Adam Tooze.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Deluge-America-Remaking-Global-1916-1931/dp/0143127977\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.amazon.com/Deluge-America-Remaking-Global-1916-1931/dp/0143127977</a></p>\n<p>Tooze wrote what I regard as the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Wages-Destruction-Making-Breaking-Economy/dp/0143113208/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_2?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=0143113208&amp;pd_rd_r=BBAHCDSPZEW8BH6Z7J85&amp;pd_rd_w=dEZw7&amp;pd_rd_wg=4B76J&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=BBAHCDSPZEW8BH6Z7J85\" rel=\"nofollow\">single best book</a> on WW2 a few years ago (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Shattered-Sword-Jonathan-Parshall-Hardcover/dp/B00849DHJK/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482086301&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=shattered+sword\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> is the only competition), and while Deluge is not quite as good, it&#x2019;s an amazing look at the the economics of WW1. </p>\n<p>Also excellent is <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1498194.Fire_In_The_Sky\" rel=\"nofollow\">fire in the sky</a> that really gets into the how and why of history, not just the what.</p>\n<p>Geoffrey Parker&#x2019;s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Army-Flanders-Spanish-Road-1567-1659/dp/0521543924\" rel=\"nofollow\">The army of Flanders</a>.

Are you looking to just stick to recipes, and get a book with a nice long list of classic recipes, or do you want to learn more about the techniques of cooking, so you can be confident in making up your own dishes and varying what you cook?</p>\n<p>If it&#x2019;s the latter, I would recommend the cookbook from seriouseats chef J. Kenji Lopez Alt (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Food-Lab-Cooking-Through-Science/dp/0393081087/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1479382785&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=kenji+lopez+alt\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.amazon.com/Food-Lab-Cooking-Through-Science/dp/0393081087/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1479382785&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=kenji+lopez+alt</a>). The style is classic American, but the recipes in the book are largely extremely complicated, such as a Chili requiring 40 ingredients and 3 days preparation. However, I&#x2019;d still say its very useful for a beginner since the recipes themselves are only a small part of the book; much of it is instead braking down the science behind the recipes and why the various extra ingredients work, which means you can basically just pick out a few innovations and put them into much simpler variations. There are also a lot of guides to things like knife skills, choosing meat and vegetables, deep frying, etc. That being said, the total number of recipes does end up being a little small, so it works best in conjunction with another cookbook so you have more potential dishes to apply the lessons to.</p>\n<p>For the former I&#x2019;d say it very much depends on what kind of food you like or where you are; I presume you&#x2019;re an American and looking for an American guide, which I couldn&#x2019;t offer.

Before that, the US had been allied with Stalin for 5 years.

During WWII, reports of Nazi concentration camps came after years of reports of Axis atrocities, so they weren&#x2019;t nearly as shocking to people back then as they are to people who are introduced to them without context today. Initial reports were also a bit confused as to the nature of the Holocaust: most wartime news articles and broadcasts about Nazi concentration camps described them as &#x201C;camps where the Nazis have placed political prisoners, a disproportionate number of whom are Jews and other ethnic minorities,&#x201D; in large part because most of the camps that the American and British forces liberated did contain large numbers of political prisoners. The camps where most of the Jewish victims were killed were liberated by the Soviets, far away from the eyes of Western reporters.</p>\n<p>After WWII, the Holocaust was downplayed in the US in significant part due to Cold War politics. It was critical that West-Germany be rebuilt and re-armed in order to prevent the Soviets from expanding further West, so focusing on German atrocities too much would have been very politically inconvenient. This still has significant effects today: notice how even modern American WWII movies rarely mention the Eastern Front.</p>\n<p>All of this changed in the 1960s and 1970s for complicated reasons, including the 1961 Eichmann trial and the rise of identity politics in the 1960s. Note that as late as 1963, when Martin Luther King Jr. brought up Hitler in his &#x201C;Letter from a Birmingham Jail,&#x201D; he immediately followed references to the Nazis with references to the Soviets: &#x201C;We should never forget that everything Adolf Hitler did in Germany was &#x2018;legal&#x2019; and everything the Hungarian freedom fighters did in Hungary was &#x2018;illegal.&#x2019; It was &#x2018;illegal&#x2019; to aid and comfort a Jew in Hitler&#x2019;s Germany. Even so, I am sure that, had I lived in Germany at the time, I would have aided and comforted my Jewish brothers. If today I lived in a Communist country where certain principles dear to the Christian faith are suppressed, I would openly advocate disobeying that country&#x2019;s antireligious laws.&#x201D; It&#x2019;s hard to imagine someone saying something like that today. A side note: I thought for more than a decade that this letter&#x2019;s reference to &#x201C;the Hungarian freedom fighters&#x201D; referred to Hungarian partisans during WWII, until I read about the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Revolution_of_1956\" rel=\"nofollow\">1956 Hungarian Revolution</a>.</p>\n<p>So we may not actually know who the next Hitler is until some 20-30 years after his/her crimes.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T16:08:26.180Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T16:08:28.700Z","PageId":223}}],"mentionCount":2},{"id":144,"title":"Hot & Heavy: Fierce Fat Girls on Life, Love & Fashion","author":"Virgie Tovar","amazonLink":"1580054382","amazonLinkImage":null,"createdAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.615Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.615Z","Mentions":[{"id":179,"mentionDate":"1455811920000","createdAt":"2017-05-06T18:13:28.910Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T18:13:28.910Z","BookId":144,"CommentId":160316,"Comment":{"id":160316,"commentUrl":"http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/02/14/ot43-roses-are-thread/","commentId":"comment-328577","commentTimestamp":"1455811920000","commentAuthor":"<a href=\"http://www.nancybuttons.com\" rel=\"external nofollow\" class=\"url\">Nancy Lebovitz</a>","commentHtml":"<p>Creutzer @ February 16, 2016 at 3:27 pm:</p>\n<p>I realize you&#x2019;re being somewhat satirical, but <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Hot-Heavy-Fierce-Girls-Fashion/dp/1580054382\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hot and Heavy</a> may be of interest since some people in this thread have suggested that obesity is part of undatability for women.</p>\n<p>The book is a bunch of accounts by fat women, and they cover the whole range from can&#x2019;t find anybody to finding true love fast, not to mention some who have a number of different partners.

The style is classic American, but the recipes in the book are largely extremely complicated, such as a Chili requiring 40 ingredients and 3 days preparation. However, I&#x2019;d still say its very useful for a beginner since the recipes themselves are only a small part of the book; much of it is instead braking down the science behind the recipes and why the various extra ingredients work, which means you can basically just pick out a few innovations and put them into much simpler variations. There are also a lot of guides to things like knife skills, choosing meat and vegetables, deep frying, etc. That being said, the total number of recipes does end up being a little small, so it works best in conjunction with another cookbook so you have more potential dishes to apply the lessons to.</p>\n<p>For the former I&#x2019;d say it very much depends on what kind of food you like or where you are; I presume you&#x2019;re an American and looking for an American guide, which I couldn&#x2019;t offer.

This is documented in an excellent work, <i><a href=\"http://smile.amazon.com/Island-at-Center-World-ebook/dp/B000FCK2Z6/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1462196643&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=island+in+the+middle+of+the+world\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Island at the Center of the World</a></i> by Russell Shorto, who argues that the uniquely American character of deal-making and &#x201C;everything&#x2019;s negotiable&#x201D; comes to us from the Dutch. He also argues&#x2013;with considerable merit in my view&#x2013;that the Dutch also brought many cultural influences which led to the strongly democratic tendencies we see in America: unlike, say, the Quakers, who (as you and Fischer describe them above) paid a great deal of lip service to the concept of equality, but who kicked the Borderers out of town when they got too rowdy, the Dutch of New Amsterdam (their name for present-day New York) actually practiced it: the New Amsterdam of its hey day was a city of whites, blacks, Indians, and every possible combination of the above&#x2013;and all competing&#x2013;squabbling, arguing, fighting&#x2013;as equals in a marketplace where all were welcome so long as they had something to offer.</p>\n<p>A few other comments, in no particular order:</p>\n<p>1. The Democratic-Republicans had NOTHING to do with the modern-day Republicans. Or everything, but then also with the modern-day Democrats. They were, for a time&#x2013;basically from the collapse of the Federalist Party in the early 1800s to the breakdown of the Democratic-Republicans into Whigs and Democrats in the 1820s, the so-called &#x201C;Era of Good Feelings&#x201D;&#x2013;the ONLY political party extant in the United States, and as such, you can argue they were the progenitors of all the rest. But the reality is that the original Republican Party of the 1850s and 1860s picked up most of the pieces of the old Whig Party and some of the Northern bits of the Democratic Party to assemble into a coalition that was centered around&#x2013;as their slogans would have it&#x2013;&#x201C;Free Soil and Free Men&#x201D;, in contradistinction to the Democratic Party, which was increasingly defined by its unwavering commitment to maintaining the &#x201C;Peculiar Institution&#x201D; as slavery was often called (note for moderns: &#x201C;peculiar&#x201D; in that era meant &#x201C;specific to&#x201D; rather than &#x201C;odd&#x201D; as we might nowadays think).</p>\n<p>2. Trying to connect the underlying views of the early settlers to modern PARTISAN divisions is hopelessly wrong: rather, you need to look past the party labels and focus on the ideological and philosophical differences. If you look at county-by-county maps of today&#x2019;s partisan alignments you will find they are almost exactly the negative image of the partisan alignments of a century ago, when the South and West were largely DEMOCRATIC areas (except for the West Coast, where the coastal areas were predominantly Republican) and New England, the Mid-Atlantic region and the Midwest were largely REPUBLICAN. But if you look past the party labels you can discern some interesting connections.</p>\n<p>3. The Michigan experience you reference is far from unique. In his important work, <i><a href=\"http://smile.amazon.com/Emerging-Republican-Majority-American-Politics-ebook/dp/B00M5JXUHO/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1462198047&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=emerging+republican+majority\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Emerging Republican Majority</a></i>, Kevin Phillips shows that migration patterns in the United States&#x2013;with one important exception&#x2013;were from East to West <b>along essentially the same lines of latitude</b>. So northwestern areas like Michigan, Minnesota, Washington and Oregon tended to be settled by people from New England (Portland, Oregon was named after Portland, Maine, and could as easily have been named for Boston, Mass) and the mid-Atlantic&#x2013;i.e. Puritans and Quakers&#x2013;whereas more southwestern areas&#x2013;Arizona, New Mexico, and southern California&#x2013;tended to be settled by Southerners&#x2013;Cavaliers and Borderers. The notable exception? The Great Migrations of blacks, which as one might guess went from South to North: we think of blacks as being largely an urban people, but in reality, until the 1920s, most blacks lived in the rural South (gee, I wonder why?).</p>\n<p>4. Northern New England was both heavily Republican and conservative until the last half-century, when the native population was numerically overwhelmed by the in-migration of Bostonians (to southern New Hampshire) and New Yorkers and others (to Vermont and Maine). As these were smaller states to begin with, much of the remaining &#x201C;footprint&#x201D; of the original settlers is now confined to the relatively inaccessible and rural parts of these states. You also see this happening&#x2013;albeit to a lesser degree&#x2013;in some of the Mountain states, e.g. Arizona (huge influx of retirees), New Mexico (huge influx of &#x201C;alternate&#x201D; cultist types) and Colorado (huge influx of urbanites of all sorts). Notice however that Utah, Idaho and Wyoming seem to have been much less susceptible, possibly on account of the large Mormon footprint in those states.</p>\n<p>I could add a few other things but those are the big ones. I could also give you some suggestions as to how to disentangle things, but that&#x2019;s an entirely new topic, so I&#x2019;ll let it go! &#x1F642;</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T16:07:45.119Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T16:07:46.927Z","PageId":219}}],"mentionCount":1},{"id":49,"title":"The Economic Laws of Scientific Research","author":"Terence Kealey","amazonLink":"0312173067","amazonLinkImage":null,"createdAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.604Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.604Z","Mentions":[{"id":67,"mentionDate":"1472586300000","createdAt":"2017-05-06T18:08:31.067Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T18:08:31.067Z","BookId":49,"CommentId":90588,"Comment":{"id":90588,"commentUrl":"http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/08/28/ot57-chopin-thread/","commentId":"comment-403714","commentTimestamp":"1472586300000","commentAuthor":"<a href=\"http://www.daviddfriedman.com\" rel=\"external nofollow\" class=\"url\">David Friedman</a>","commentHtml":"<p>Three comments on the subject of government funding of basic research:</p>\n<p>Terence Kealey <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Economic-Laws-Scientific-Research/dp/0312173067\" rel=\"nofollow\">offers evidence</a> that it doesn&#x2019;t result in increased progress, using cases where government funding sharply increased at a specific time.</p>\n<p>2.

You have a belief system.  You believe it without evidence and/or you make up the evidence as you go along, in the way that you interpret events in your (or your patient&#x2019;s) life within the framework of your belief system.  And you are clueless as to how subjective this all is.</p>\n<p>Belief systems seem rational to people.  But really they are just big security blankets, or life preservers, to satisfy one&#x2019;s needs for emotional security, and for certainty.  Through them, you know exactly the right or virtuous action to take in any situation.  You know exactly how to be an expert in your profession, even if you just read your very first book about it.  </p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s an accident of history that the highest status psychotherapists are psychiatrists, in the current system.  Although there are exceptions to the rule, the average psychologist or social worker usually knows more about how to do psychotherapy than the average psychiatrist does, for a number of reasons. These reasons include not suffering much from sleep deprivation during training, as psychiatrists do; not having most of their training be about medicine rather than psychology; and being more grounded and sensitive, on average, due to having lower status and less power.   </p>\n<p>There are some advantages that psychiatrists do have though, such as knowing how to prescribe medications when needed, and being able to recognize it more easily when the supposed mental disorder is actually a physical disorder.         </p>\n<p>Belief systems must be very necessary for humans, because they are everywhere, and some of them even successfully charge super high prices for entry.  </p>\n<p>There is the rationalist belief system.  Rationalists really think they are being logical and rational while they nit pick, cherry pick, lemon pick etc.</p>\n<p>There is the Right Wing ideological system so common on this board when politics comes up.  To me this looks and feels exactly like a Right Wing Safe Space and echo chamber bubble.  But to most participants on this board, who are Right Wing themselves, I am sure that the board appears to be rational and objective.  </p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s hard to see a belief system objectively, when you are inside of it.</p>\n<p>One giant overarching belief seems to be a belief in black/white thinking.  And there is lots of that in our culture.  E.g. if you think the job of psychotherapist has to never require an M.D. or always require one.  If you have to always talk at the object level or always at the meta level.  Or if you have to always piss off your patients, or always be nice to them.  If you have to only  be open to a patient and connect with them as a human vs. if you have to always be practically a robot in your dispensation of medication or advice or response to patient&#x2019;s words with particular techniques.    </p>\n<p>Some therapists, and patients, seem to be caught within such black/white frameworks.  But psychotherapy is actually as large as human life, human needs, and the meanings humans give to their lives, and the traumas and other experiences that humans have and their effects.  That&#x2019;s why so many therapists run screaming and then look to find their certainty in rigid belief systems.  </p>\n<p>And the great variety of things that different patients need mean that it can be difficult for a patient to find a good match in a therapist.  If the therapist is all empathy, and you need direction or challenge&#x2014;or vice versa&#x2014;then you need to find someone who is a better match.  </p>\n<p>Sometimes you can do this by phone by asking what kinds of interventions the therapist does to help their patients.  And of course, some therapists can both challenge a patient and give empathy, as needed.  But there is an interpersonal chemistry involved, where some therapist/patient duos are great matches, and others do not work at all.  </p>\n<p>The same for therapy groups and support groups.  AA is some people&#x2019;s wonderful solution, and other people&#x2019;s pointless exercise in futility, depending on their needs and also on the other personalities present in the group.  Interestingly, some of the best AA groups contain people who have been through a lot of psychotherapy themselves.     </p>\n<p>One psychology professor I once had, asked me &#x201C;How can you be aware of what&#x2019;s not there?&#x201D;  When he asked me, I didn&#x2019;t know the answer, nor did he.  But now I think I know.  You are aware of what&#x2019;s not there, from experience&#x2013; your own, your patients&#x2019; experiences, the experiences of the people around you.  You can tell what is missing when things aren&#x2019;t going well for a patient, by observing what is present when things ARE working well for people in their lives.    </p>\n<p>Cognitive distortions come into play in schools of psychotherapy, as in much of life.  There are interesting books written about cognitive distortions, like </p>\n<p>You Are Not So Smart: Why You Have Too Many Friends on Facebook, Why Your Memory Is Mostly Fiction, an d 46 Other Ways You&#x2019;re Deluding Yourself Paperback &#x2013; November 6, 2012<br>\nby David McRaney</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/You-Are-Not-So-Smart/dp/1592407366/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483029059&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=you+are+now+less+dumb\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.amazon.com/You-Are-Not-So-Smart/dp/1592407366/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483029059&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=you+are+now+less+dumb</a></p>\n<p>You are Now Less Dumb: How to Conquer Mob Mentality, How to Buy Happiness, and All the Other Ways to Outsmart Yourself Paperback &#x2013; August 5, 2014<br>\nby David McRaney </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/You-are-Now-Less-Dumb/dp/1592408796/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483029059&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=you+are+now+less+dumb\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.amazon.com/You-are-Now-Less-Dumb/dp/1592408796/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483029059&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=you+are+now+less+dumb</a></p>\n<p>One of the distortions covered in this latter book here is deindividuation, through which, despite our best intentions, we pretty much disappear when subsumed by a mob mentality.</p>\n<p>People think of mobs as big angry crowds outdoors.  But the group of people in one&#x2019;s professional training program can be a sort of mob&#x2013; and indeed is more powerful, for a longer time, over the individual than your typical mob.  You can&#x2019;t just walk away and go back home in an hour&#x2013; not if you really want the degree or the professional license you are pursuing.</p>\n<p>Many schools of psychology are religion and are also power politics&#x2013; due to the power that supervisors have over trainees, and the power that trainees and other therapists have over vulnerable and sick patients.  To use power appropriately and for good, rather than for evil, or rather than for getting hopelessly lost with your power  and not having any idea what the impact of your own behavior is, is a challenge that few humans seem to be capable of dealing with well. </p>\n<p>Not going along with the prevailing belief system can put one in a really bad position.  So many people just chime in and go along to get along&#x2013; patients, psychotherapist trainees, people whose families or friends or colleagues or favorite Internet board all lean the same way politically etc. </p>\n<p>My favorite book that I have read in a long time proposes an overall framework for therapists, parents, teachers, spouses, leaders of all kinds etc., in their work.  I am seldom impressed by a book, but this one has some good points.  The writer uses Bowen&#x2019;s family systems therapy as the basis for his theories, explained here below in wikipedia.  Although I do not believe every word of Bowen&#x2019;s theory, I find much of it useful. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bowen\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bowen</a>    </p>\n<p>The book I mentioned above, that is based on Bowen&#x2019;s theory, is A Failure of Nerve: Leadership in the Age of the Quick Fix Paperback &#x2013; February 1, 2007 by Edwin H.

The author is dead, but somehow a new edition of the book is coming out in May of this year, so there must be people thinking it is still relevant, and apparently editors adding something to it.

The school only meets three days a week (the other two days are for homework, parent-guided learning, and extra-curricular activities). There cannot be new time commitments on the day for either teachers or students, meaning the system needs to be elegant enough that one man (myself) can run it and explain it to my fellow faculty.</p>\n<p>The purpose of the house system is to increase buy-in to the school&#x2019;s model, to promote academic self-discipline (not to be confused with grit) and accomplishment by awarding them some form of ESTEEM, to provide some sense of identity to these students who among other issues, don&#x2019;t even know how to describe their school to other kids (maybe that&#x2019;s beside the point).</p>\n<p>I think three houses should do the trick.</p>\n<p>What I have come up with so far is a big brother, big sister idea such that older kids are encouraged to encourage younger kids to excel in their studies. I am not exactly sure if this part is even a good idea, but I am thinking older students two grades or more above a younger student should choose a younger student to befriend (or at least be on cordial speaking terms with) so that lunch time can be slightly de-cliqued and being a nerd isn&#x2019;t a social stigma.</p>\n<p>My other idea is to wed the house system to school wide and class wide academic competitions that happen every year. In this way, point allocations within the system are determined in advance and don&#x2019;t seem biased and arbitrary. There are no new entities created by doing this and the points are based on real aivities that happen anyway.</p>\n<p>The reward structure is ESTEEM POINTS (framed in a way yet to be determined) from administration/faculty, which cascades down, I deeply hope, into tribe comraderie. At the end of the year, there will be a party for everyone in honor of the winning house.</p>\n<p>Bias alert: I have been reading a lot Gabor Mate and Neufeld, and especially his book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Hold-Your-Kids-Parents-Matter/dp/0375760288?ie=UTF8&amp;*Version*=1&amp;*entries*=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hold On To Your Kids</a>. There is a lot of relationship theory and attachment theory in these works, and its epistemic status is fairly unknown to me (I&#x2019;d be very interested if Scott had any opinions on this matter). But it rings true, and since it rings true, I can&#x2019;t help but be extremely partial to their emphatic claim that attachment to one&#x2019;s peers in youth is ultimately deleterious to maturation. This, again, may be corroborated by Scott&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/23/ssc-gives-a-graduation-speech/\">idyllic graduation speech</a>. All that to say, I am trying to create a system designed so that the students take their cues from those who are more emotionally and intellectually mature, and whatever else there is, than themselves. Kids don&#x2019;t need to fall into the trap of lusting for peer approval. It&#x2019;s just no good.</p>\n<p>Final historical note: Last year, I employed a Quirrel Points system in my 9th grade class (chose that group since they were larger and more energetic), designed to reward homework completion and academic accomplishment. The purpose was to get disaffected students to participate the classroom. There was a 70% increase in participation and on average 94% of the kids completed their homework assignments. Obviously, that&#x2019;s still not that good. But we&#x2019;re getting somewhere. The issue with the Quirrel system is I can&#x2019;t foresee it working with 11th graders. They will recognize it as a gimmick, lame, or adults-trying-too-hard.</p>\n<p>The absolute key for all these things is to avoid being gimmicky and to wed points to a real foundation, such that students can gain a sense of personal accomplishment and contribution.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T16:04:59.274Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T16:04:59.883Z","PageId":196}}],"mentionCount":1},{"id":12,"title":"Ecclesiastical History of the English People","author":"Bede","amazonLink":"014044565X","amazonLinkImage":null,"createdAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.594Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.594Z","Mentions":[{"id":163,"mentionDate":"1468869420000","createdAt":"2017-05-06T18:12:18.026Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T18:12:18.026Z","BookId":12,"CommentId":106272,"Comment":{"id":106272,"commentUrl":"http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/07/17/ot54-threadical-doctor/","commentId":"comment-385601","commentTimestamp":"1468869420000","commentAuthor":"HircumSaecuolroum","commentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Ecclesiastical-History-English-Penguin-Classics/dp/014044565X\" rel=\"nofollow\">Penguin&#x2019;s version</a> (translated from Latin) is what I read, and I believe it&#x2019;s the standard.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T16:02:48.914Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T16:02:50.216Z","PageId":178}}],"mentionCount":1},{"id":88,"title":"Theological Incorrectness: Why Religious People Believe What They Shouldn't","author":"D.

I worry that the sort of people who run things &#x201C;like a business&#x201D; do not really care about children very much, and are motivated by the wrong incentives.

First, the mainstream should be told that gays are victims of fate, in the sense that most never had a choice to accept or reject their sexual preference. The message must read: &#x201C;As far as gays can tell, they were born gay, just as you were born heterosexual or white or black or bright or athletic. Nobody ever tricked or seduced them; they never made a choice, and are not morally blameworthy. What they do isn&#x2019;t willfully contrary &#x2013; it&#x2019;s only natural for them.

Seated in homey surroundings, they respond to an off camera interviewer with assurance, good nature, and charm. Their comments bring out three social facts:</p>\n<p>1. There is someone special in their life, a long-term relationship (to stress gay stability, monogamy, commitment);</p>\n<p>2. Their families are very important to them, and are supportive of them (to stress that gays are not &#x201C;anti-family,&#x201D; and that families need not be anti-gay.)</p>\n<p>3. As far as they can remember they have always been gay, and were probably born gay; they certainly never decided on a preference one way or the other (stressing that gays are doing what is natural for them, and are not being willfully contrary). The subjects should be interviewed alone, not with their lovers or children, for to include others in the picture would unwisely raise disturbing questions about the complexities of gay social relations, which these commercials could not explain. It is best instead to take one thing at a time.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I thought this was only anti-gay propaganda and never really suggested by gay rights groups or representatives, but no, it was a suggested campaign to gain sympathy and &#x2018;normalise&#x2019; LGBT as much as possible to overcome resistance from the majority.</p>\n<p>Kirk went on to write a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/After-Ball-America-Conquer-Hatred/dp/0452264987\" rel=\"nofollow\">book</a> with Hunter Madsen called &#x201C;After the Ball: How America Will Conquer Its Fear and Hatred of Gays in the 90s&#x201D;.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T15:59:08.623Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T15:59:09.064Z","PageId":139}}],"mentionCount":1},{"id":353,"title":"Anger and Forgiveness: Resentment, Generosity, Justice","author":"Martha C.

There&#x2019;s an associated reader, too &#x2013; but it&#x2019;s not necessary (a decent bible plus the internet ought to provide most of it) &#x2013; and I recall some of the footnotes in the edition I had being missing.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Testament-Anchor-Reference-Library/dp/0300140169/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1463664559&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=raymond+brown\" rel=\"nofollow\">Raymond Brown&#x2019;s introduction</a> I remember as being good too, but I spent less time with it than with Ehrman. As I recall, Brown was really big on John &#x2013; John usually gets less attention than the synoptics. </p>\n<p>Also, Ehrman is an evangelical Protestant turned agnostic, whereas Brown was a Catholic. So they&#x2019;re going to have somewhat different approaches. </p>\n<p>A good bible is a must. NRSV is pretty standard for scholarship these days. One really cool thing I have is the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Jewish-Annotated-New-Testament/dp/0195297709\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jewish Annotated New Testament</a>, which is a footnoted NRSV New Testament with essays and such by Jewish scholars. Really helps put things in context. </p>\n<p>If you don&#x2019;t have any Greek, and even if you do, a gospel synopsis is helpful  in letting you compare the four gospels, and compare the Greek to the English. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Synopsis-Four-Gospels-Quattuor-Evangeliorum/dp/3438054051\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Aland one</a> is kind of the gold standard. I actually preferred <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Parallel-Gospels-Synopsis-Christian-Writing/dp/0199739412/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1463665099&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=zeba+crook\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Zeba Crook one</a> which is a literal word-for-word translation with a glossary. It is better for letting you compare the Greek to the English and see where translations flatten things out and so forth. If you really want to get hardcore, a Greek lexicon can help &#x2013; I remember liking <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Analytical-Lexicon-Greek-New-Testament/dp/0310542103/ref=sr_1_14?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1463665450&amp;sr=1-14&amp;keywords=mounce\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mounce&#x2019;s analytical lexicon</a> but then again I was taking Greek, so it might be a bit much. </p>\n<p>Finally, if you&#x2019;re doing historical-critical studies, the parables probably interest you. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Stories-Intent-Comprehensive-Guide-Parables/dp/0802842410/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1463665816&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=klyne+snodgrass\" rel=\"nofollow\">This</a> was one of the texts for a course I took on the parables, and I remember it being really good.

There&#x2019;s an associated reader, too &#x2013; but it&#x2019;s not necessary (a decent bible plus the internet ought to provide most of it) &#x2013; and I recall some of the footnotes in the edition I had being missing.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Testament-Anchor-Reference-Library/dp/0300140169/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1463664559&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=raymond+brown\" rel=\"nofollow\">Raymond Brown&#x2019;s introduction</a> I remember as being good too, but I spent less time with it than with Ehrman. As I recall, Brown was really big on John &#x2013; John usually gets less attention than the synoptics. </p>\n<p>Also, Ehrman is an evangelical Protestant turned agnostic, whereas Brown was a Catholic. So they&#x2019;re going to have somewhat different approaches. </p>\n<p>A good bible is a must. NRSV is pretty standard for scholarship these days. One really cool thing I have is the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Jewish-Annotated-New-Testament/dp/0195297709\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jewish Annotated New Testament</a>, which is a footnoted NRSV New Testament with essays and such by Jewish scholars. Really helps put things in context. </p>\n<p>If you don&#x2019;t have any Greek, and even if you do, a gospel synopsis is helpful  in letting you compare the four gospels, and compare the Greek to the English. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Synopsis-Four-Gospels-Quattuor-Evangeliorum/dp/3438054051\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Aland one</a> is kind of the gold standard. I actually preferred <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Parallel-Gospels-Synopsis-Christian-Writing/dp/0199739412/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1463665099&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=zeba+crook\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Zeba Crook one</a> which is a literal word-for-word translation with a glossary. It is better for letting you compare the Greek to the English and see where translations flatten things out and so forth. If you really want to get hardcore, a Greek lexicon can help &#x2013; I remember liking <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Analytical-Lexicon-Greek-New-Testament/dp/0310542103/ref=sr_1_14?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1463665450&amp;sr=1-14&amp;keywords=mounce\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mounce&#x2019;s analytical lexicon</a> but then again I was taking Greek, so it might be a bit much. </p>\n<p>Finally, if you&#x2019;re doing historical-critical studies, the parables probably interest you. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Stories-Intent-Comprehensive-Guide-Parables/dp/0802842410/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1463665816&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=klyne+snodgrass\" rel=\"nofollow\">This</a> was one of the texts for a course I took on the parables, and I remember it being really good. It gives a good overview of religious and scholarly interpretation of the parables.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T16:06:40.544Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T16:06:41.518Z","PageId":209}}],"mentionCount":1},{"id":274,"title":"We're with Nobody: Two Insiders Reveal the Dark Side of American Politics","author":"Alan Huffman","amazonLink":"006201577X","amazonLinkImage":null,"createdAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.633Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.633Z","Mentions":[{"id":236,"mentionDate":"1460995560000","createdAt":"2017-05-06T18:21:19.978Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T18:21:19.978Z","BookId":274,"CommentId":140641,"Comment":{"id":140641,"commentUrl":"http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/04/15/links-416-they-cant-link-our-dick/","commentId":"comment-347831","commentTimestamp":"1460995560000","commentAuthor":"<a href=\"http://politicalgraveyard.com\" rel=\"external nofollow\" class=\"url\">Larry Kestenbaum</a>","commentHtml":"<blockquote><p>As for the thinly-veiled hint that Trump is going to bribe(*) the uncommitted delegates &#x2026; you can&#x2019;t bribe eighty party activists without having several of them talk&#x2026;</p></blockquote>\n<p>That&#x2019;s only a problem if it involves literal envelopes of cash, as opposed to nice favors that a powerful politician can do for a mere delegate.</p>\n<p>If things get to the point where, say, 35 more votes would get Trump the nomination, I can&#x2019;t imagine every uncommitted delegate standing firm.</p>\n<p>Almost everyone has embarrassing secrets they don&#x2019;t want exposed.

You have a belief system.  You believe it without evidence and/or you make up the evidence as you go along, in the way that you interpret events in your (or your patient&#x2019;s) life within the framework of your belief system.  And you are clueless as to how subjective this all is.</p>\n<p>Belief systems seem rational to people.  But really they are just big security blankets, or life preservers, to satisfy one&#x2019;s needs for emotional security, and for certainty.  Through them, you know exactly the right or virtuous action to take in any situation.  You know exactly how to be an expert in your profession, even if you just read your very first book about it.  </p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s an accident of history that the highest status psychotherapists are psychiatrists, in the current system.  Although there are exceptions to the rule, the average psychologist or social worker usually knows more about how to do psychotherapy than the average psychiatrist does, for a number of reasons. These reasons include not suffering much from sleep deprivation during training, as psychiatrists do; not having most of their training be about medicine rather than psychology; and being more grounded and sensitive, on average, due to having lower status and less power.   </p>\n<p>There are some advantages that psychiatrists do have though, such as knowing how to prescribe medications when needed, and being able to recognize it more easily when the supposed mental disorder is actually a physical disorder.         </p>\n<p>Belief systems must be very necessary for humans, because they are everywhere, and some of them even successfully charge super high prices for entry.  </p>\n<p>There is the rationalist belief system.  Rationalists really think they are being logical and rational while they nit pick, cherry pick, lemon pick etc.</p>\n<p>There is the Right Wing ideological system so common on this board when politics comes up.  To me this looks and feels exactly like a Right Wing Safe Space and echo chamber bubble.  But to most participants on this board, who are Right Wing themselves, I am sure that the board appears to be rational and objective.  </p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s hard to see a belief system objectively, when you are inside of it.</p>\n<p>One giant overarching belief seems to be a belief in black/white thinking.  And there is lots of that in our culture.  E.g. if you think the job of psychotherapist has to never require an M.D. or always require one.  If you have to always talk at the object level or always at the meta level.  Or if you have to always piss off your patients, or always be nice to them.  If you have to only  be open to a patient and connect with them as a human vs. if you have to always be practically a robot in your dispensation of medication or advice or response to patient&#x2019;s words with particular techniques.    </p>\n<p>Some therapists, and patients, seem to be caught within such black/white frameworks.  But psychotherapy is actually as large as human life, human needs, and the meanings humans give to their lives, and the traumas and other experiences that humans have and their effects.  That&#x2019;s why so many therapists run screaming and then look to find their certainty in rigid belief systems.  </p>\n<p>And the great variety of things that different patients need mean that it can be difficult for a patient to find a good match in a therapist.  If the therapist is all empathy, and you need direction or challenge&#x2014;or vice versa&#x2014;then you need to find someone who is a better match.  </p>\n<p>Sometimes you can do this by phone by asking what kinds of interventions the therapist does to help their patients.  And of course, some therapists can both challenge a patient and give empathy, as needed.  But there is an interpersonal chemistry involved, where some therapist/patient duos are great matches, and others do not work at all.  </p>\n<p>The same for therapy groups and support groups.  AA is some people&#x2019;s wonderful solution, and other people&#x2019;s pointless exercise in futility, depending on their needs and also on the other personalities present in the group.  Interestingly, some of the best AA groups contain people who have been through a lot of psychotherapy themselves.     </p>\n<p>One psychology professor I once had, asked me &#x201C;How can you be aware of what&#x2019;s not there?&#x201D;  When he asked me, I didn&#x2019;t know the answer, nor did he.  But now I think I know.  You are aware of what&#x2019;s not there, from experience&#x2013; your own, your patients&#x2019; experiences, the experiences of the people around you.  You can tell what is missing when things aren&#x2019;t going well for a patient, by observing what is present when things ARE working well for people in their lives.    </p>\n<p>Cognitive distortions come into play in schools of psychotherapy, as in much of life.  There are interesting books written about cognitive distortions, like </p>\n<p>You Are Not So Smart: Why You Have Too Many Friends on Facebook, Why Your Memory Is Mostly Fiction, an d 46 Other Ways You&#x2019;re Deluding Yourself Paperback &#x2013; November 6, 2012<br>\nby David McRaney</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/You-Are-Not-So-Smart/dp/1592407366/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483029059&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=you+are+now+less+dumb\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.amazon.com/You-Are-Not-So-Smart/dp/1592407366/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483029059&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=you+are+now+less+dumb</a></p>\n<p>You are Now Less Dumb: How to Conquer Mob Mentality, How to Buy Happiness, and All the Other Ways to Outsmart Yourself Paperback &#x2013; August 5, 2014<br>\nby David McRaney </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/You-are-Now-Less-Dumb/dp/1592408796/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483029059&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=you+are+now+less+dumb\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.amazon.com/You-are-Now-Less-Dumb/dp/1592408796/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483029059&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=you+are+now+less+dumb</a></p>\n<p>One of the distortions covered in this latter book here is deindividuation, through which, despite our best intentions, we pretty much disappear when subsumed by a mob mentality.</p>\n<p>People think of mobs as big angry crowds outdoors.  But the group of people in one&#x2019;s professional training program can be a sort of mob&#x2013; and indeed is more powerful, for a longer time, over the individual than your typical mob.  You can&#x2019;t just walk away and go back home in an hour&#x2013; not if you really want the degree or the professional license you are pursuing.</p>\n<p>Many schools of psychology are religion and are also power politics&#x2013; due to the power that supervisors have over trainees, and the power that trainees and other therapists have over vulnerable and sick patients.  To use power appropriately and for good, rather than for evil, or rather than for getting hopelessly lost with your power  and not having any idea what the impact of your own behavior is, is a challenge that few humans seem to be capable of dealing with well. </p>\n<p>Not going along with the prevailing belief system can put one in a really bad position.  So many people just chime in and go along to get along&#x2013; patients, psychotherapist trainees, people whose families or friends or colleagues or favorite Internet board all lean the same way politically etc. </p>\n<p>My favorite book that I have read in a long time proposes an overall framework for therapists, parents, teachers, spouses, leaders of all kinds etc., in their work.  I am seldom impressed by a book, but this one has some good points.  The writer uses Bowen&#x2019;s family systems therapy as the basis for his theories, explained here below in wikipedia.  Although I do not believe every word of Bowen&#x2019;s theory, I find much of it useful. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bowen\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bowen</a>    </p>\n<p>The book I mentioned above, that is based on Bowen&#x2019;s theory, is A Failure of Nerve: Leadership in the Age of the Quick Fix Paperback &#x2013; February 1, 2007 by Edwin H. Friedman.  The author is dead, but somehow a new edition of the book is coming out in May of this year, so there must be people thinking it is still relevant, and apparently editors adding something to it.  I don&#x2019;t agree with everything in the book, but do with a lot of it.  Even where I disagree, it stimulates my thinking.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Failure-Nerve-Leadership-Age-Quick/dp/159627042X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483030635&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=A+Failure+of+Nerve\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.amazon.com/Failure-Nerve-Leadership-Age-Quick/dp/159627042X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483030635&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=A+Failure+of+Nerve</a></p>\n<p>From the summary on Amazaon: &#x201C;he argues for strength and self-differentiation as the marks of true leadership. His formula for success is more maturity, not more data; stamina, not technique; and personal responsibility, not empathy.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>That quote makes it sound more black/white than the book really is&#x2013; and definitely more black/white than the way I apply what I learned from the book.  But it does give you an idea of the areas of emphasis in the book.  Anyway, I highly recommend it for psychotherapists, teachers, leaders and everyone who wants to be more aware of the impact of your behavior on others.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T15:54:35.804Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T15:54:36.075Z","PageId":87}}],"mentionCount":1},{"id":321,"title":"Wired to Create: Unraveling the Mysteries of the Creative Mind","author":"Scott Barry Kaufman","amazonLink":"0399174109","amazonLinkImage":null,"createdAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.643Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.643Z","Mentions":[{"id":190,"mentionDate":"1471207740000","createdAt":"2017-05-06T18:14:07.333Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T18:14:07.333Z","BookId":321,"CommentId":96024,"Comment":{"id":96024,"commentUrl":"http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/08/12/links-816-ode-on-a-grecian-url/","commentId":"comment-397344","commentTimestamp":"1471207740000","commentAuthor":"Jill","commentHtml":"<p>There are books about this.

They&#x2019;re called fat pigs and all kinds of other names.  Look at what Donald Trump has said about women he didn&#x2019;t like&#x2013; and they were not even hitting on him.  They were just going about their lives, doing what they do, and he had the urge to insult them.</p>\n<p>I think there are a lot of misunderstandings in general when people try to communicate anyway.  There are tons of misunderstandings on this board.  But sexual/romantic interest situations are worse than most, because people want so much to be attractive to people who are attractive to them.  </p>\n<p>Also there is this shame factor that seems to originate in more than one place&#x2013; traditional religious attitudes toward sex for one origin.  Another origin is both traditional and current rank and status hierarchies among humans. </p>\n<p>There are wealth, career, attractiveness, small group, and social status hierarchies that people pay attention to.  And if someone is lower than you are in rank&#x2013; or you consider them to be, then maybe you abuse your  rank and insult them, which is unnecessary and quite unkind.</p>\n<p>There is a recent and excellent book about abuse of rank.  It&#x2019;s not specifically about unpleasant  interactions where someone is searching for romance, but those are certainly one subset of what the author is talking about</p>\n<p>Somebodies and Nobodies: Overcoming the Abuse of Rank Paperback &#x2013; April 1, 2004<br>\nby Robert W.

It&#x2019;s fascinating stuff. </p>\n<p>Two Irish brothers are convicted of murder but pardoned by the king, apparently because their sister is a lady of easy virtue who has been sleeping with some powerful men in a position to exert political pressure. The Wilkites respond with an appeal of murder&#x2013;a private criminal case. As Blackstone explains (while telling the reader that the appeal of felony still exists in the law but nobody does it any more because it really isn&#x2019;t practical), if someone is convicted in an appeal of felony the king cannot pardon him because the king is not a party to the suit&#x2013;any more than the king could cancel a tort verdict awarding damages. They don&#x2019;t succeed&#x2013;Blackstone was correct. </p>\n<p>But the attempt gladdens my radical heart, fitting neatly with my old argument that one reason the English maintained a system of privately prosecuted criminal law for so long was that, after the lively events of the 17th century, they realized that if the crown controlled prosecution the king&#x2019;s friends could get away with  murder.</p>\n<p>Lots of other neat stuff. I think I posted here on the question of whether law enforcement agents should be subject to the same penalties, civil and criminal, as other people. The Wilkites thought they should. When there was a demonstration in favor of Wilkes outside the prison where he was being held and it ended up with troops shooting some people, the Wilkites, who were conveniently in control of London at the time, charged not only some of the soldiers but one of the JP&#x2019;s in charge with murder. They didn&#x2019;t get a conviction, in part because the defendant soldier most clearly guilty was granted bail and vanished, but the JP seems to have been seriously scared of the risk of being tried for murder by a London jury.</p>\n<p>And Wilkes and his friends did succeed in winning a case for large damages against the Secretary of State and some of his agents, in the process establishing the principle that a blank warrant was not valid in British law, from which we get our fourth amendment.</p>\n<p>For anyone else interested in this stuff, the piece is a chapter in <i>An Ungovernable People</i>.

Clear patterns in what kind of states they described and the progression in these states and how achieving them changed their life and well being. Way beyond what anything else can do.</p>\n<p>Also check out this book:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Enlightenment-Changes-Your-Brain-Transformation/dp/1594633452\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.amazon.com/Enlightenment-Changes-Your-Brain-Transformation/dp/1594633452</a></p>\n<p>And this audio series:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk1VPN5lugw\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk1VPN5lugw</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Science-Enlightenment-Shinzen-Young/dp/1591792320\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.amazon.com/Science-Enlightenment-Shinzen-Young/dp/1591792320</a></p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T16:07:42.712Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T16:07:43.147Z","PageId":218}}],"mentionCount":1},{"id":5,"title":"Jesus and the Eyewitnesses","author":"Richard Bauckham","amazonLink":"0802863906","amazonLinkImage":null,"createdAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.592Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.592Z","Mentions":[{"id":79,"mentionDate":"1463600940000","createdAt":"2017-05-06T18:08:48.926Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T18:08:48.926Z","BookId":5,"CommentId":129745,"Comment":{"id":129745,"commentUrl":"http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/05/18/open-thread-49-75/","commentId":"comment-360059","commentTimestamp":"1463600940000","commentAuthor":"<a href=\"http://jaskology.com\" rel=\"external nofollow\" class=\"url\">Jaskologist</a>","commentHtml":"<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Jesus-Eyewitnesses-Gospels-Eyewitness-Testimony/dp/0802863906\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jesus and the Eyewitnesses</a> is large and thorough, but quite readable if you&#x2019;re into that sort of thing.</p>\n<p>A few chapters of it are summarized nicely in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5Ylt1pBMm8\" rel=\"nofollow\">this engaging talk</a>. tldr; They analyze the Gospels and Acts statistically by comparing the frequency of names with the actual frequency of names for the area and time span they describe.</p>\n<p>Don&#x2019;t bother with Carrier; mythicists are considered cranks for a reason.

Even if there&#x2019;s a lot of inefficiency and waste, pro-gov blue tribe doesn&#x2019;t think it outweighs the positive utility it provides.</p>\n<p>To give a short list:<br>\n1) Cutting social programs that people depend on (food stamps, medicaid, etc).<br>\n2) Regressive tax policies that hurt low-income earners.<br>\n3) Deregulation that increases the risk of 2008-housing-bubble-style systemic risk.<br>\n4) Repealing environmental protections that increase risk of disease or death through air pollution, etc.<br>\n5) Eliminating public assets by selling them to private corporations.<br>\n6) Outlawing abortion, or instituting laws meant to make the process as difficult and painful as possible (even in cases of rape, for some Republicans).<br>\n7) Repealing smoking bans, thereby increasing the risk of lung cancer.<br>\n8) Starting more unnecessary wars, increasing the national debt, creating more terrorist groups like ISIS, higher risk of terrorist attacks, more refugees, and loss of life for both U.S. soldiers and foreign civilians.<br>\n9) Overlaps with (1), but blocking healthcare legislation which has literally saved the lives of people I know (by allowing coverage despite pre-existing conditions).<br>\n10) Creating more &#x201C;tough on crime&#x201D; policies (e.g. drug wars, mandatory minimums, three-strikes laws) which increase the prison population and the chance that ordinary citizens will develop criminal records, spend time in jail, be unable to get a job, or contract HIV in prison, for non-violent crimes.<br>\n11) Causing government shutdowns in fights over routine legislation, suspending government programs and causing economic contractions.</p>\n<p>I could keep going.

Thinking back, I believe I may have been requested to prove this more than once here.  Not something I&#x2019;m really interested in myself, but apparently it is very important to at least one or two of the devotees of Saint Ayn.  Although I&#x2019;ve read The Virtue of Selfishness by Ayn Rand  and Nathaniel Branden, years ago, I certainly am not willing to go back and read all 173 pages of it now.</p>\n<p>But I noticed there is a wikipedia written about the book and about how Rand uses the term &#x201C;selfishness&#x201D; within it.  And I am quite willing to read that, in order to acquaint myself with something that is of apparent great importance to one or more persons here. </p>\n<p>&#x201C;Rand acknowledged in the book&#x2019;s introduction that the term &#x2018;selfishness&#x2019; was not typically used to describe virtuous behavior, but insisted that her usage was consistent with a more precise meaning of the term as simply &#x201C;concern with one&#x2019;s own interests.&#x201D; The equation of selfishness with evil, Rand said, had caused &#x201C;the arrested moral development of mankind&#x201D; and needed to be rejected.[5]&#x201D;</p>\n<p>My own view is that &#x201C;selfish&#x201D; is one of those words like &#x201C;love&#x201D; that sure means a lot of different things to a lot of different people.  The 2 meanings that are most problematic in my view are 1) the meaning that makes concern with one&#x2019;s own interests always a virtue i.e, the meaning that Paul Ryan and other people who worship at the Church of Neoliberal Economics (AKA the First Church of Ayn) give to the word and 2) the meaning that makes concern with one&#x2019;s own interests always a flaw.  </p>\n<p>In my view, taking care of one&#x2019;s own best interests is a virtue, as long as you don&#x2019;t cause unnecessary harm to others such as e.g. killing them, robbing them or poisoning their air, water, food etc.&#x2013; EVEN IF you have no intention of doing these things, and no knowledge that you have done them.  Even if you are the CEO who has surrounded yourself with Yes Men and Yes Women, because they know how to help you make money for your business, and know how to lobby Congress for regulatory capture by your company, and know how to not bother you with the gory details of who was harmed in the process and how.  </p>\n<p>So selfishness, or concern with one&#x2019;s own interests, in my view, can be either a virtue or a flaw&#x2013; depending on how you do it.</p>\n<p>I disagree with Rand about many things, and I agree with her about some things.  I certainly agree that various forms of unselfishness can also be either a virtue or a flaw.  Psychotherapists refer to the type of unselfishness that is a flaw, as being &#x201C;codependent&#x201D;, or being an &#x201C;enabler&#x201D;, where you help people so much that you drain yourself unnecessarily, and/or you encourage them in alcoholism or other behavior through which they weaken themselves.  </p>\n<p>Both the kind of selfishness that is a flaw, and the kind of unselfishness that is a flaw contribute greatly to societal, economic and political problems, in addition to being individual personal problems for people.  </p>\n<p>I wish that our society could become less ideological so that we could address all of those kinds of problems and improve our ways of doing things so that they are more just and fair than they are now.</p>\n<p>But we&#x2019;re very polarized now, so that is not possible yet.  And part of the polarization is the Selfishness is Always the Highest Virtue church vs. the Selfishness is Always the Worst Evil Church.  </p>\n<p>And so far&#x2013; Never the twain shall meet.</p>\n<p>I would very much like the twain to meet though.  I think that would be great if the twain would meet.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T16:00:23.863Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T16:00:24.738Z","PageId":153}}],"mentionCount":1},{"id":211,"title":"Lives of a Cell: Notes of a Biology Watcher","author":"Lewis Thomas","amazonLink":"0140047433","amazonLinkImage":null,"createdAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.629Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.629Z","Mentions":[{"id":93,"mentionDate":"1460401260000","createdAt":"2017-05-06T18:09:11.857Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T18:09:11.857Z","BookId":211,"CommentId":142862,"Comment":{"id":142862,"commentUrl":"http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/04/11/ot47-openai/","commentId":"comment-345264","commentTimestamp":"1460401260000","commentAuthor":"FullMeta_Rationalist","commentHtml":"<p>Fun digression regarding antibiotics. </p>\n<p>I read an ADORABLE book once, called <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Lives-Cell-Notes-Biology-Watcher/dp/0140047433%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAILSHYYTFIVPWUY6Q%26tag%3Dduckduckgo-d-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0140047433\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lives of a Cell: Notes of a Biology Watcher</a>.

There&#x2019;s an associated reader, too &#x2013; but it&#x2019;s not necessary (a decent bible plus the internet ought to provide most of it) &#x2013; and I recall some of the footnotes in the edition I had being missing.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Testament-Anchor-Reference-Library/dp/0300140169/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1463664559&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=raymond+brown\" rel=\"nofollow\">Raymond Brown&#x2019;s introduction</a> I remember as being good too, but I spent less time with it than with Ehrman. As I recall, Brown was really big on John &#x2013; John usually gets less attention than the synoptics. </p>\n<p>Also, Ehrman is an evangelical Protestant turned agnostic, whereas Brown was a Catholic. So they&#x2019;re going to have somewhat different approaches. </p>\n<p>A good bible is a must. NRSV is pretty standard for scholarship these days. One really cool thing I have is the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Jewish-Annotated-New-Testament/dp/0195297709\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jewish Annotated New Testament</a>, which is a footnoted NRSV New Testament with essays and such by Jewish scholars. Really helps put things in context. </p>\n<p>If you don&#x2019;t have any Greek, and even if you do, a gospel synopsis is helpful  in letting you compare the four gospels, and compare the Greek to the English. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Synopsis-Four-Gospels-Quattuor-Evangeliorum/dp/3438054051\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Aland one</a> is kind of the gold standard. I actually preferred <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Parallel-Gospels-Synopsis-Christian-Writing/dp/0199739412/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1463665099&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=zeba+crook\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Zeba Crook one</a> which is a literal word-for-word translation with a glossary. It is better for letting you compare the Greek to the English and see where translations flatten things out and so forth. If you really want to get hardcore, a Greek lexicon can help &#x2013; I remember liking <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Analytical-Lexicon-Greek-New-Testament/dp/0310542103/ref=sr_1_14?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1463665450&amp;sr=1-14&amp;keywords=mounce\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mounce&#x2019;s analytical lexicon</a> but then again I was taking Greek, so it might be a bit much. </p>\n<p>Finally, if you&#x2019;re doing historical-critical studies, the parables probably interest you. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Stories-Intent-Comprehensive-Guide-Parables/dp/0802842410/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1463665816&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=klyne+snodgrass\" rel=\"nofollow\">This</a> was one of the texts for a course I took on the parables, and I remember it being really good. It gives a good overview of religious and scholarly interpretation of the parables.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T16:06:40.544Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T16:06:41.518Z","PageId":209}}],"mentionCount":1},{"id":69,"title":"Red Families v.

You have a belief system.  You believe it without evidence and/or you make up the evidence as you go along, in the way that you interpret events in your (or your patient&#x2019;s) life within the framework of your belief system.  And you are clueless as to how subjective this all is.</p>\n<p>Belief systems seem rational to people.  But really they are just big security blankets, or life preservers, to satisfy one&#x2019;s needs for emotional security, and for certainty.  Through them, you know exactly the right or virtuous action to take in any situation.  You know exactly how to be an expert in your profession, even if you just read your very first book about it.  </p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s an accident of history that the highest status psychotherapists are psychiatrists, in the current system.  Although there are exceptions to the rule, the average psychologist or social worker usually knows more about how to do psychotherapy than the average psychiatrist does, for a number of reasons. These reasons include not suffering much from sleep deprivation during training, as psychiatrists do; not having most of their training be about medicine rather than psychology; and being more grounded and sensitive, on average, due to having lower status and less power.   </p>\n<p>There are some advantages that psychiatrists do have though, such as knowing how to prescribe medications when needed, and being able to recognize it more easily when the supposed mental disorder is actually a physical disorder.         </p>\n<p>Belief systems must be very necessary for humans, because they are everywhere, and some of them even successfully charge super high prices for entry.  </p>\n<p>There is the rationalist belief system.  Rationalists really think they are being logical and rational while they nit pick, cherry pick, lemon pick etc.</p>\n<p>There is the Right Wing ideological system so common on this board when politics comes up.  To me this looks and feels exactly like a Right Wing Safe Space and echo chamber bubble.  But to most participants on this board, who are Right Wing themselves, I am sure that the board appears to be rational and objective.  </p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s hard to see a belief system objectively, when you are inside of it.</p>\n<p>One giant overarching belief seems to be a belief in black/white thinking.  And there is lots of that in our culture.  E.g. if you think the job of psychotherapist has to never require an M.D. or always require one.  If you have to always talk at the object level or always at the meta level.  Or if you have to always piss off your patients, or always be nice to them.  If you have to only  be open to a patient and connect with them as a human vs. if you have to always be practically a robot in your dispensation of medication or advice or response to patient&#x2019;s words with particular techniques.    </p>\n<p>Some therapists, and patients, seem to be caught within such black/white frameworks.  But psychotherapy is actually as large as human life, human needs, and the meanings humans give to their lives, and the traumas and other experiences that humans have and their effects.  That&#x2019;s why so many therapists run screaming and then look to find their certainty in rigid belief systems.  </p>\n<p>And the great variety of things that different patients need mean that it can be difficult for a patient to find a good match in a therapist.  If the therapist is all empathy, and you need direction or challenge&#x2014;or vice versa&#x2014;then you need to find someone who is a better match.  </p>\n<p>Sometimes you can do this by phone by asking what kinds of interventions the therapist does to help their patients.  And of course, some therapists can both challenge a patient and give empathy, as needed.  But there is an interpersonal chemistry involved, where some therapist/patient duos are great matches, and others do not work at all.  </p>\n<p>The same for therapy groups and support groups.  AA is some people&#x2019;s wonderful solution, and other people&#x2019;s pointless exercise in futility, depending on their needs and also on the other personalities present in the group.  Interestingly, some of the best AA groups contain people who have been through a lot of psychotherapy themselves.     </p>\n<p>One psychology professor I once had, asked me &#x201C;How can you be aware of what&#x2019;s not there?&#x201D;  When he asked me, I didn&#x2019;t know the answer, nor did he.  But now I think I know.  You are aware of what&#x2019;s not there, from experience&#x2013; your own, your patients&#x2019; experiences, the experiences of the people around you.  You can tell what is missing when things aren&#x2019;t going well for a patient, by observing what is present when things ARE working well for people in their lives.    </p>\n<p>Cognitive distortions come into play in schools of psychotherapy, as in much of life.  There are interesting books written about cognitive distortions, like </p>\n<p>You Are Not So Smart: Why You Have Too Many Friends on Facebook, Why Your Memory Is Mostly Fiction, an d 46 Other Ways You&#x2019;re Deluding Yourself Paperback &#x2013; November 6, 2012<br>\nby David McRaney</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/You-Are-Not-So-Smart/dp/1592407366/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483029059&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=you+are+now+less+dumb\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.amazon.com/You-Are-Not-So-Smart/dp/1592407366/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483029059&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=you+are+now+less+dumb</a></p>\n<p>You are Now Less Dumb: How to Conquer Mob Mentality, How to Buy Happiness, and All the Other Ways to Outsmart Yourself Paperback &#x2013; August 5, 2014<br>\nby David McRaney </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/You-are-Now-Less-Dumb/dp/1592408796/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483029059&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=you+are+now+less+dumb\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.amazon.com/You-are-Now-Less-Dumb/dp/1592408796/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483029059&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=you+are+now+less+dumb</a></p>\n<p>One of the distortions covered in this latter book here is deindividuation, through which, despite our best intentions, we pretty much disappear when subsumed by a mob mentality.</p>\n<p>People think of mobs as big angry crowds outdoors.  But the group of people in one&#x2019;s professional training program can be a sort of mob&#x2013; and indeed is more powerful, for a longer time, over the individual than your typical mob.  You can&#x2019;t just walk away and go back home in an hour&#x2013; not if you really want the degree or the professional license you are pursuing.</p>\n<p>Many schools of psychology are religion and are also power politics&#x2013; due to the power that supervisors have over trainees, and the power that trainees and other therapists have over vulnerable and sick patients.  To use power appropriately and for good, rather than for evil, or rather than for getting hopelessly lost with your power  and not having any idea what the impact of your own behavior is, is a challenge that few humans seem to be capable of dealing with well. </p>\n<p>Not going along with the prevailing belief system can put one in a really bad position.  So many people just chime in and go along to get along&#x2013; patients, psychotherapist trainees, people whose families or friends or colleagues or favorite Internet board all lean the same way politically etc. </p>\n<p>My favorite book that I have read in a long time proposes an overall framework for therapists, parents, teachers, spouses, leaders of all kinds etc., in their work.  I am seldom impressed by a book, but this one has some good points.  The writer uses Bowen&#x2019;s family systems therapy as the basis for his theories, explained here below in wikipedia.  Although I do not believe every word of Bowen&#x2019;s theory, I find much of it useful. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bowen\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bowen</a>    </p>\n<p>The book I mentioned above, that is based on Bowen&#x2019;s theory, is A Failure of Nerve: Leadership in the Age of the Quick Fix Paperback &#x2013; February 1, 2007 by Edwin H. Friedman.  The author is dead, but somehow a new edition of the book is coming out in May of this year, so there must be people thinking it is still relevant, and apparently editors adding something to it.  I don&#x2019;t agree with everything in the book, but do with a lot of it.  Even where I disagree, it stimulates my thinking.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Failure-Nerve-Leadership-Age-Quick/dp/159627042X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483030635&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=A+Failure+of+Nerve\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.amazon.com/Failure-Nerve-Leadership-Age-Quick/dp/159627042X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483030635&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=A+Failure+of+Nerve</a></p>\n<p>From the summary on Amazaon: &#x201C;he argues for strength and self-differentiation as the marks of true leadership. His formula for success is more maturity, not more data; stamina, not technique; and personal responsibility, not empathy.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>That quote makes it sound more black/white than the book really is&#x2013; and definitely more black/white than the way I apply what I learned from the book.  But it does give you an idea of the areas of emphasis in the book.  Anyway, I highly recommend it for psychotherapists, teachers, leaders and everyone who wants to be more aware of the impact of your behavior on others.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T15:54:35.804Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T15:54:36.075Z","PageId":87}}],"mentionCount":1},{"id":87,"title":"The Chronicles of Master Li and Number Ten Ox","author":"Barry Hughart","amazonLink":"B005ISOYLK","amazonLinkImage":null,"createdAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.608Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.608Z","Mentions":[{"id":317,"mentionDate":"1474427100000","createdAt":"2017-05-06T18:52:21.275Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T18:52:21.275Z","BookId":87,"CommentId":82724,"Comment":{"id":82724,"commentUrl":"http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/09/18/open-thread-58-5/","commentId":"comment-411710","commentTimestamp":"1474427100000","commentAuthor":"LHN","commentHtml":"<p>I had no idea the Hughart books were available as ebooks.

There&#x2019;s an associated reader, too &#x2013; but it&#x2019;s not necessary (a decent bible plus the internet ought to provide most of it) &#x2013; and I recall some of the footnotes in the edition I had being missing.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Testament-Anchor-Reference-Library/dp/0300140169/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1463664559&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=raymond+brown\" rel=\"nofollow\">Raymond Brown&#x2019;s introduction</a> I remember as being good too, but I spent less time with it than with Ehrman. As I recall, Brown was really big on John &#x2013; John usually gets less attention than the synoptics. </p>\n<p>Also, Ehrman is an evangelical Protestant turned agnostic, whereas Brown was a Catholic. So they&#x2019;re going to have somewhat different approaches. </p>\n<p>A good bible is a must. NRSV is pretty standard for scholarship these days. One really cool thing I have is the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Jewish-Annotated-New-Testament/dp/0195297709\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jewish Annotated New Testament</a>, which is a footnoted NRSV New Testament with essays and such by Jewish scholars. Really helps put things in context. </p>\n<p>If you don&#x2019;t have any Greek, and even if you do, a gospel synopsis is helpful  in letting you compare the four gospels, and compare the Greek to the English. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Synopsis-Four-Gospels-Quattuor-Evangeliorum/dp/3438054051\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Aland one</a> is kind of the gold standard. I actually preferred <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Parallel-Gospels-Synopsis-Christian-Writing/dp/0199739412/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1463665099&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=zeba+crook\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Zeba Crook one</a> which is a literal word-for-word translation with a glossary. It is better for letting you compare the Greek to the English and see where translations flatten things out and so forth. If you really want to get hardcore, a Greek lexicon can help &#x2013; I remember liking <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Analytical-Lexicon-Greek-New-Testament/dp/0310542103/ref=sr_1_14?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1463665450&amp;sr=1-14&amp;keywords=mounce\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mounce&#x2019;s analytical lexicon</a> but then again I was taking Greek, so it might be a bit much. </p>\n<p>Finally, if you&#x2019;re doing historical-critical studies, the parables probably interest you. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Stories-Intent-Comprehensive-Guide-Parables/dp/0802842410/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1463665816&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=klyne+snodgrass\" rel=\"nofollow\">This</a> was one of the texts for a course I took on the parables, and I remember it being really good. It gives a good overview of religious and scholarly interpretation of the parables.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T16:06:40.544Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T16:06:41.518Z","PageId":209}}],"mentionCount":1},{"id":155,"title":"Food and Western Disease: Health and Nutrition from an Evolutionary Perspective","author":"Stefan Lindeberg","amazonLink":"1405197714","amazonLinkImage":null,"createdAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.625Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.625Z","Mentions":[{"id":300,"mentionDate":"1473830820000","createdAt":"2017-05-06T18:41:47.133Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T18:41:47.133Z","BookId":155,"CommentId":84433,"Comment":{"id":84433,"commentUrl":"http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/09/13/some-context-for-that-nyt-sugar-article/","commentId":"comment-408900","commentTimestamp":"1473830820000","commentAuthor":"zz","commentHtml":"<p>My background in nutrition is that I read <a href=\"amazon.com/Food-Western-Disease-Evolutionary-Perspective/dp/1405197714\" rel=\"nofollow\">Food and Western Disease</a>.

When fruits or root vegetables were staple foods, carbohydrate intake was high.

Eating a lot of calories with few micronutrients won&#x2019;t end well, no matter how they&#x2019;re proportioned.</p>\n<p>And, for what it&#x2019;s worth, Food and Western Disease advocates for a paleo diet and doesn&#x2019;t give two darns about macronutrient composition, beyond getting enough protein, even though most paleo blogs treat carbohydrates as the Worst Possible Thing. Also, it convinced me to eat soylent (proper amount of micronutrient to the calorie!) which, from a certain perspective, is literally the furthest thing from paleo.

(Not yours; it was pretty mild.)</p>\n<p>An AI has several advantages over a puling infant. First, its actual day-to-day needs are small. Second, if those needs are met, it has no significant lifespan limitations, so it can be patient. Third, it may be capable of more focused behavior: a human&#x2019;s ability to take over the world is hampered by a huge array of evolved sub-conscious and conflicting goals, and arguably humans don&#x2019;t have <i>any</i> &#x201C;terminal goals&#x201D;. Fourth, we have presumably created the human-level AI for <i>some</i> purpose, so we&#x2019;ll probably give it access to <i>some</i> resources from the get-go; the purpose will probably not be a secret from the AI itself, so coming up with an argument for more resources &#x2014; even if that&#x2019;s just the ability to run a copy or ten in parallel &#x2014; shouldn&#x2019;t be hard for it to come up with.</p>\n<p>I recommend J.

So even superhuman AIs will have to accommodate other superhuman AIs, and the framework in which they will do so is the one we already have.</p>\n<p>I don&#x2019;t find it convincing enough to make me disregard Bostrom, and I still donate to MIRI, but it&#x2019;s an interesting perspective. And unlike Bostrom, Hall has actually worked on AI technology &#x2014; though I can&#x2019;t say whether that gives him a clearer eye or just means he&#x2019;s blinkered by the past. Hall&#x2019;s book wanders around a bit, but the route is scenic.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T15:57:27.786Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T15:57:27.926Z","PageId":126}}],"mentionCount":1},{"id":327,"title":"Salamander","author":"David D.

A more involved friend assures me this is an appropriate time and place to plug a project of mine, but I apologize if this a little more self-interested than is considered cool around here.</p>\n<p>Some associates of mine recently put a lot of effort into e-publishing a novel that I wrote as a younger man.  It kind of tests the boundaries of what you can call a novel, but, in any case, it&#x2019;s a book-length fictional narrative.  Years ago, Andrew Hussie (now of MSPaintAdventures fame, then about to be of Problem Sleuth fame) did some illustrations for the book.  The best description/explanation of the book I can give you is an excerpt from an email I sent to Hussie in the course of planning the illustrations.  It follows below.</p>\n<p>The book is called Eidophusikon.

Honestly, most of the holes in the story flat-out don&#x2019;t matter; if you can keep track of &#x201C;this guy wants to kill that guy, and this guy owes this woman something for something, and this woman has a mysterious past,&#x201D; you should be able to make it through a single reading without too much pain.  (I don&#x2019;t know what &#x201C;should&#x201D; means in that context.)  There are connections to draw down the line, after you&#x2019;ve read it all, if you care enough to do so, but that&#x2019;s putting the manure before the horse.</p>\n<p>The phony confusion is why the fuck the story&#x2019;s written the way it is.  By which I mean, out of chronological order, and with huge gaps between events.  I don&#x2019;t know whether that&#x2019;s high concept or what the hell.  The real deal is that there have been a number of narratives I&#x2019;ve encountered in a disorganized way, and loved, only to be disappointed when I found the correct order and the whole story. </p>\n<p>One, maybe the first, was Liquid Television on MTV, especially the old Aeon Flux shorts.  My brother and I would watch the show whenever we could catch it on, but we never seemed to know when it was on.  So, we ended up seeing all these serial cartoons out of order, and trying to figure out what was going on.  With Aeon Flux, it was pretty difficult, because there wasn&#x2019;t much explanation of what was going on, except that this woman wanted to kill this guy, and there was some disease killing people, and the woman may have been dreaming the entire thing.  My brother and I thought we had it all figured out, until we saw an episode that played the entire Aeon Flux serial in order, and we realized we weren&#x2019;t even close.  Oh well.</p>\n<p>It happened to me repeatedly with big, expansive, sci-fi/fantasy universes that seem impossibly complicated to an outsider.  I started reading X-Men comics in the middle of The X-cutioner&#x2019;s Song, some byzantine four-title crossover that barely makes sense to anybody.  What&#x2019;s interesting about that story arc is that it&#x2019;s all about a villain whose motives nobody understands, but who is slowly revealed to be seeking vengeance for some past wrong that seems more imagined than real.  That meant that I, some kid who just knows what powers these people have and what color underwear they display, was largely in the same boat as some of the characters.  There was so much information out there that no matter how deep I dug into the mythology, my understanding was becoming richer and my appreciation greater.  It was years before I realized that X-Men comics were stupid as hell.</p>\n<p>Then, the same thing happened to me with Dragon Ball Z, and probably something else at some time, but I think you get my point.  I was finding things that were mysterious and intriguing foe the newcomer, but stupid as hell to the expert.  Well, except Aeon Flux.  I still like that stuff.</p>\n<p>Shortly before I started writing Chilling Like Didymus, which was originally intended to be a self-contained detective novel, I watched Mulholland Drive, and sort of fell in love with the movie.  I watched it about a half a million times, and thought I had figured some stuff out, but it was still rather baffling.  Then I started reading stuff online, and the common consensus was that the first 2/3 of the movie was a dream.  I thought that was a bullshit solution, but upon further inspection, I realized that was almost certainly correct.  I looked hard for a way that might not be the solution, but I could come up with nothing else that wasn&#x2019;t equally dumb.</p>\n<p>I also read the book Who Censored Roger Rabbit? around that time.  (The movie Who Framed Roger Rabbit? was based off that book, in the sense that they both featured characters named &#x201C;Roger Rabbit.&#x201D;)  I liked the book a lot, and it was probably the first mystery novel I&#x2019;d ever read.  The ending reveal was absolutely ludicrous, in a way that didn&#x2019;t really impede appreciation of the story.  I&#x2019;ve since read most of the Sherlock Holmes stuff, The Maltese Falcon, Edgar Allen Poe&#x2019;s detective stuff&#x2013;it&#x2019;s all well and good, but the solutions generally aren&#x2019;t any less ridiculous than the twist in Roger Rabbit&#x2019;s book.  (Eddie Valiant boxes a genie!  NO SHIT.)</p>\n<p>So, I set out to write this detective story, with this totally batshit twist to it that I took from an interview Robert Anton Wilson gave to some weird Canadian radio personality named Nardwaar.  Wilson told this stupid joke about how Timothy Leary&#x2019;s ashes had been condensed into some kind of super drug.  I quickly realized that didn&#x2019;t really give me the basis for any sort of mystery, so I started dumping in other shit from the interview: Hitler&#x2019;s cock&#x2019;s whereabouts, secret societies, sex and magic and bullshit.  At this point, I no longer remember what the original plot was, or how I intended to wrap up the story.</p>\n<p>I had it all planned out, though, and I started writing a bunch of the scenes.  I didn&#x2019;t write in chronological order, though, because I&#x2019;d get so excited about future scenes that I&#x2019;d just jump ahead to writing them.  So, eventually, I had all these disconnected scenes, and a general plan, and I suddenly realized that some of my scenes were narrated in first person, and some were in third.  I honestly have no idea how I could have written several scenes without considering that problem, especially since John Tanis&#x2019;s voice is completely different from the matter-of-fact proclamations of the third-person narrator.  Maybe I knew it all along and didn&#x2019;t care.  I don&#x2019;t remember.</p>\n<p>So, I had all these important scenes written out, all in the same document, but all disconnected.  And it hit me that all those boring connecting scenes really weren&#x2019;t all that important, that with the information in there everyone could tell what was going on, and really, the only thing I&#x2019;d be doing by telling the whole story is dragging it out too fucking long.</p>\n<p>Then I changed some stuff so it made less sense, and put the sections in the wrong order.</p>\n<p>Now, I realized I was recreating the sort of confusion I appreciated from the earlier works I mentioned.  Except, here, the confusion would be perpetual.  I devised several solutions to the mystery of Danielle&#x2019;s death, and made sure to keep the story logically consistent with all of them.  Literarily, not all solutions are equal, and one solution is certainly hinted at more than others.  But, the point was to ensure that no one could ever discover, &#x201C;Oh, the genie did it,&#x201D; and feel secure in that solution.</p>\n<p>Then, I got the bright idea to expand the story.  I changed the ending again (I don&#x2019;t remember what it used to be), and tried to not do the same thing three times, but probably did.</p>\n<p>The thing is, The Two Travelers was not intended to be chronologically confusing.  Actually, once you realize that it&#x2019;s telling three separate stories, you can easily determine that each story is being told in chronological order; the chronological confusion comes from the intersection of the three stories.</p>\n<p>I long regretted that I made The Two Travelers so straightforward.  Maybe that was not a legitimate preoccupation.</p>\n<p>The thing is, while I always tried to have some plausible explanation for the nitty-gritty of the story, I just don&#x2019;t think it matters enough to explain in the book.  Why the fuck would William State arrange for his death to trigger a self-destruct sequence?  That&#x2019;s just idiotic.  And why the hell does Rock Mahon need to kill everybody who spoke the John Tanis?  Doesn&#x2019;t that raise more suspicion?</p>\n<p>And that&#x2019;s sort of where the fairy tale business comes in.  These things are based on other stories.  They&#x2019;re not all fairy tales, but they&#x2019;re all those sorts of stories.  And because I&#x2019;m forcing these characters into these roles, to those who would ask, &#x201C;Why the hell would this happen?&#x201D;, I can only offer, &#x201C;But it did happen.&#x201D;  That may not be a particularly satisfying answer.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Eve&#x2019;s Various Children&#x201D; is probably the best example of this type of horseshit. Even within the context of this book, it makes no sense.  A professional hitman picks up a bunch of unknown, loitering weirdos to a professor&#x2019;s house, where they all proceed to make themselves at home, and then gang up to harass and murder the professor.  For good measure, the professor is referred to as both male and female.</p>\n<p>Well, Jesus, how do you explain that?  There&#x2019;s a Grimm Fairy Tale, &#x201C;Mister Korbes,&#x201D;  in which a bunch of animals and inanimate objects meet up and travel to visit Mister Korbes.  He&#x2019;s not home when they arrive, so they situate themselves in the joint and get comfortable.  Mister Korbes finally arrives, and they kill him.  The only hint of an explanation?  &#x201C;What a bad man he must have been!&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Jesus, how do you explain that?</p>\n<p>Alright, so there&#x2019;s some nonsensical fairy tale, and I decide to base part of the story on it.  Does that really justify my story making no sense?  I guess I just don&#x2019;t see it as important.  Yeah, it&#x2019;s utterly ridiculous.  You could probably assume, even within the context of the story, that it couldn&#x2019;t really happen as it was described; that shouldn&#x2019;t affect the rest of the story.  Rock Mahon killed Dr. Yice&#x2013;does it matter whether he did it with a gun or a Communist?</p>\n<p>Honestly, that part&#x2019;s so far gone that even I don&#x2019;t really consider it part of the story.  But it does serve as fair warning, I think, for how crazy this shit&#x2019;s about to get.  Self-destruct sequence?  Ok, I guess.  &#x201C;Kill everybody&#x201D;?  Meh, why not.</p>\n<p>And that third section, well, it seems pretty straight-forward to me too, but I&#x2019;m sure I&#x2019;m wrong about that.</p>\n<p>I suppose the summary of all that is that I intended to recreate an aesthetic effect that I have failed utterly to recreate in another human being.  Actually, it worked with one guy, but heI&#x2019;m&#x2019;s kind of a weirdo.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T16:01:57.797Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T16:01:59.173Z","PageId":169}}],"mentionCount":1},{"id":385,"title":"America's Premier Gunmakers","author":"K.D.

For every Grant there is a Lee (cavalier), for every Jackson a Sherman (one of the oldest Puritan families).</p></blockquote>\n<p>Deor&#x2019;s inclusion of Sherman in this list indicates that he fails to grasp that Fischer doesn&#x2019;t claim that it&#x2019;s the four groups&#x2019; genetic heritage that is at issue. Rather, Fischer&#x2019;s point is that it&#x2019;s the cultural heritages of these groups that matters for understanding American history. Sherman <i>was</i> of good Puritan stock. As a general, however, he was the consummate Borderer: ruthless and vicious towards enemies who still fight back, magnanimous and generous towards enemies who have surrendered. For the purpose of historical analysis, Sherman&#x2019;s genetic heritage is immaterial. For all intents and purposes, he was a Borderer.</p>\n<blockquote><p>If rural Indiana is now Republican country, that has nothing to do with the origin of its settlers.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This error is tied to the point above. It has nothing to do with <i>the genetic heritage</i> of its settlers; it has everything to do with what became <i>the dominant culture</i> of its settlers. While Quakers and Puritans were certainly the first to move there, the later Borderers established the state&#x2019;s dominant culture.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It was [Southerners&#x2019;] loss to anti-slavery forces in the 1860 election and then the war that turned them, for generations, against the Federal government.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This, as a broad generalization, is simply false. Mark David Ledbetter makes this point very clear in the first two volumes of his magnificent <b><i>America&#x2019;s Forgotten History</i></b> series: <b><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Americas-Forgotten-History-Part-Foundations-ebook/dp/B003GXEU90\" rel=\"nofollow\">Foundations</a></b> and <b><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Americas-Forgotten-History-Part-Rupture-ebook/dp/B003GXEU1S\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rupture</a></b>. Southerners had a deep general hostility towards federal government power from the very beginning. Even the one massively glaring and stupendously hypocritical exception to that hostility &#x2014; slavery &#x2014; didn&#x2019;t develop until the late 1830s at the earliest. And after the Civil War, Southerners kept their massively inconsistent and stupendously hypocritical streak: they generally opposed the use of federal power <i>except</i> when it supported and enabled Jim Crow laws. Thus, they lauded <i>Plessy v. Ferguson</i> and many of Wilson&#x2019;s racist policies.</p>\n<p>The lesson IMO is that reality is always more complicated than our explanations of it. That goes for history, but also for any other disciplines that purports to explain how the world works, including the physical sciences. If we don&#x2019;t simplify it to at least some degree, we usually can&#x2019;t explain it.

This is documented in an excellent work, <i><a href=\"http://smile.amazon.com/Island-at-Center-World-ebook/dp/B000FCK2Z6/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1462196643&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=island+in+the+middle+of+the+world\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Island at the Center of the World</a></i> by Russell Shorto, who argues that the uniquely American character of deal-making and &#x201C;everything&#x2019;s negotiable&#x201D; comes to us from the Dutch. He also argues&#x2013;with considerable merit in my view&#x2013;that the Dutch also brought many cultural influences which led to the strongly democratic tendencies we see in America: unlike, say, the Quakers, who (as you and Fischer describe them above) paid a great deal of lip service to the concept of equality, but who kicked the Borderers out of town when they got too rowdy, the Dutch of New Amsterdam (their name for present-day New York) actually practiced it: the New Amsterdam of its hey day was a city of whites, blacks, Indians, and every possible combination of the above&#x2013;and all competing&#x2013;squabbling, arguing, fighting&#x2013;as equals in a marketplace where all were welcome so long as they had something to offer.</p>\n<p>A few other comments, in no particular order:</p>\n<p>1. The Democratic-Republicans had NOTHING to do with the modern-day Republicans. Or everything, but then also with the modern-day Democrats. They were, for a time&#x2013;basically from the collapse of the Federalist Party in the early 1800s to the breakdown of the Democratic-Republicans into Whigs and Democrats in the 1820s, the so-called &#x201C;Era of Good Feelings&#x201D;&#x2013;the ONLY political party extant in the United States, and as such, you can argue they were the progenitors of all the rest. But the reality is that the original Republican Party of the 1850s and 1860s picked up most of the pieces of the old Whig Party and some of the Northern bits of the Democratic Party to assemble into a coalition that was centered around&#x2013;as their slogans would have it&#x2013;&#x201C;Free Soil and Free Men&#x201D;, in contradistinction to the Democratic Party, which was increasingly defined by its unwavering commitment to maintaining the &#x201C;Peculiar Institution&#x201D; as slavery was often called (note for moderns: &#x201C;peculiar&#x201D; in that era meant &#x201C;specific to&#x201D; rather than &#x201C;odd&#x201D; as we might nowadays think).</p>\n<p>2. Trying to connect the underlying views of the early settlers to modern PARTISAN divisions is hopelessly wrong: rather, you need to look past the party labels and focus on the ideological and philosophical differences. If you look at county-by-county maps of today&#x2019;s partisan alignments you will find they are almost exactly the negative image of the partisan alignments of a century ago, when the South and West were largely DEMOCRATIC areas (except for the West Coast, where the coastal areas were predominantly Republican) and New England, the Mid-Atlantic region and the Midwest were largely REPUBLICAN. But if you look past the party labels you can discern some interesting connections.</p>\n<p>3. The Michigan experience you reference is far from unique. In his important work, <i><a href=\"http://smile.amazon.com/Emerging-Republican-Majority-American-Politics-ebook/dp/B00M5JXUHO/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1462198047&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=emerging+republican+majority\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Emerging Republican Majority</a></i>, Kevin Phillips shows that migration patterns in the United States&#x2013;with one important exception&#x2013;were from East to West <b>along essentially the same lines of latitude</b>. So northwestern areas like Michigan, Minnesota, Washington and Oregon tended to be settled by people from New England (Portland, Oregon was named after Portland, Maine, and could as easily have been named for Boston, Mass) and the mid-Atlantic&#x2013;i.e. Puritans and Quakers&#x2013;whereas more southwestern areas&#x2013;Arizona, New Mexico, and southern California&#x2013;tended to be settled by Southerners&#x2013;Cavaliers and Borderers. The notable exception? The Great Migrations of blacks, which as one might guess went from South to North: we think of blacks as being largely an urban people, but in reality, until the 1920s, most blacks lived in the rural South (gee, I wonder why?).</p>\n<p>4. Northern New England was both heavily Republican and conservative until the last half-century, when the native population was numerically overwhelmed by the in-migration of Bostonians (to southern New Hampshire) and New Yorkers and others (to Vermont and Maine). As these were smaller states to begin with, much of the remaining &#x201C;footprint&#x201D; of the original settlers is now confined to the relatively inaccessible and rural parts of these states. You also see this happening&#x2013;albeit to a lesser degree&#x2013;in some of the Mountain states, e.g. Arizona (huge influx of retirees), New Mexico (huge influx of &#x201C;alternate&#x201D; cultist types) and Colorado (huge influx of urbanites of all sorts). Notice however that Utah, Idaho and Wyoming seem to have been much less susceptible, possibly on account of the large Mormon footprint in those states.</p>\n<p>I could add a few other things but those are the big ones.

At the most general, Darwin&#x2019;s &#x201C;theory&#x201D; was more of an observation. Scott is doing something similar by pointing out that if we trace the history of the Major World Religions, it appears they were once fully-fledged cultures.

He had this theory that Moses was actually a sympathetic Egyptian Noble and that his Jewish Birth was a convenient fiction. He also had this theory that Judaism came into contact with (and was strongly influenced by) Zoroastrianism sometime between the Egyptian Exodus and the Fall of Jericho, and that this is from where Judaism&#x2019;s &#x201C;Light vs Darkness&#x201D; meme originates. I dunno how accurate this is (Freud himself said both hypotheses were tentative), but they&#x2019;re most certainly falsifiable.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T16:08:33.013Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T16:08:33.454Z","PageId":224}}],"mentionCount":1},{"id":287,"title":"Lies: And the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right","author":"Al Franken","amazonLink":"0452285216","amazonLinkImage":null,"createdAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.635Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.635Z","Mentions":[{"id":149,"mentionDate":"1458224580000","createdAt":"2017-05-06T18:11:35.296Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T18:11:35.296Z","BookId":287,"CommentId":151794,"Comment":{"id":151794,"commentUrl":"http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/03/13/ot45-opal-thread/","commentId":"comment-336729","commentTimestamp":"1458224580000","commentAuthor":"<a href=\"http://jaskology.com\" rel=\"external nofollow\" class=\"url\">Jaskologist</a>","commentHtml":"<p>He actually tried to stick to books originally; bringing up TV was an own-goal, because there&#x2019;s the issue of The Daily Show and Colbert Report to consider.</p>\n<p>But if you&#x2019;re stuck on books, there&#x2019;s always the one that helped propel <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Lies-Lying-Liars-Tell-Them/dp/0452285216\" rel=\"nofollow\">Al Franken</a> to the Senate.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T16:09:38.727Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T16:09:39.868Z","PageId":233}}],"mentionCount":1},{"id":298,"title":"The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement","author":"Eliyahu M.

Sometimes people not in your field can give useful feedback too.  Do you ever mention your questions of interest in your field here on SSC?  Of course, feedback wouldn&#x2019;t be as focused within your field or as detailed as you&#x2019;d get from people in your field, but still it might be worthwhile.</p>\n<p>Another thing that crosses my mind is that you might want to pay an editor, who edits intellectual books in various areas, for some feedback.</p>\n<p>It sounds like it does work to some degree when the 2nd-most prestigious journal gets your heavily edited and polished article which has received a ton of useful critique from the reviewers of the 1st-most prestigious journal which rejected it.  You could also try reversing that process.  Why not submit to the 2nd-most prestigious journal first, at least on occasion, and thus shoot for ultimate publication in the 1st most prestigious journal? </p>\n<p>One thing I would do&#x2013; but I&#x2019;m an extrovert and this may not be easy for some people&#x2013; would be to go to academic conferences in my field and look for people who seem altruistic enough that they might be willing to give feedback to a colleague.  Or else just cooperative enough that they may be willing to do a trade.  And also sharp enough in their knowledge of the field that their feedback would be worthwhile.  I&#x2019;d get phone numbers and/or emails of such people.  Then I&#x2019;d see if I could trade a few things back and forth with them by email, giving each other feedback, and if it was useful.  If you start a blog, you can email the web site of your blog out to those who are interested and whom you trust. </p>\n<p>This sort of thing works for me for various purposes.  I have a Ph.D. and am a writer and a personal growth aficionado.  I&#x2019;ve been trading personal growth exercises by phone for over a year now with someone with a similar degree of sophistication to me, in the areas of interest to me.  It&#x2019;s working out very well.  But it took a while and a number of conferences to find such a person.  </p>\n<p>Of course, if you are concerned about getting scooped, you would want to step into such a relationship rather gradually and notice how they act and respond to you and others.

Those are also interesting data points.  Here&#x2019;s a simple model that seems to explain a lot of data: (1) Social justice people cause drama wherever they go.  (2) Male-dominated groups are highly fertile ground for social justice people.  (Probably because they tend to be filled with undersocialized nerds who believe that female SJW entryists to their group represent the perspective of your average woman.  Undersocialized nerds then either proceed to become SJWs themselves, because that&#x2019;s apparently the only way women will ever like you, or start hating women, because apparently they&#x2019;re all SJWs.  Either response draws more SJWs: the first obviously creates them, and the second brings them in to respond to the problem of undersocialized nerds hating women.)</p>\n<p>This suggests that male-dominated groups wishing to avoid drama should take a proactive approach to bringing non social justicey women in to their group, or at least getting their members some friendly contact with women on an occasional basis.  Examples: Make your hub a city that has <a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/Date-onomics-Dating-Became-Lopsided-Numbers/dp/076118208X/\" rel=\"nofollow\">excess single women, not excess single men</a>.  (Hint: NOT the Bay Area.)  Dual class in hobbies like ballroom dancing or acting that skew female.  Use strategies that will *actually* work for improving your group&#x2019;s gender ratio instead of providing SJWs a platform for their endless complaining (that often has the effect of driving women away and perpetuating the cycle).</p>\n<p>Problem: Publicly discussing strategies for finding women can create friction if women are already a part of the group.  The more machiavellian women may try to block such efforts in order to preserve their privileged status within the group.  I&#x2019;m not sure how to solve this.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T16:00:41.541Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T16:00:42.193Z","PageId":156}}],"mentionCount":1}]
