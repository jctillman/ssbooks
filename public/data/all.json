It is perhaps the nerdiest book I&#x2019;ve ever read, and I read a lot of textbooks. Key quote:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nWhatever standpoint you take in the debate about carbohydrate intake and health, you seem to have a problem with the early man. When fruits or root vegetables were staple foods, carbohydrate intake was high. Sometimes, honey may have been consumed in considerable amounts for a couple of months, resulting in a high intake of fructose and glucose in roughly equal amounts. In most other habitats it was lower, often much lower, than the average today.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The book also includes <a href=\"http://www.lakartidningen.se/OldWebArticleImages/6/6110/large/LKT0805s269_270_259039.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> image with the caption &#x201C;Fat and carbohydrates &#x2013; both to the left and to the right.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>My impression echoes Scott&#x2019;s: fat vs sugar seems to be a red herring. Eating a lot of calories with few micronutrients won&#x2019;t end well, no matter how they&#x2019;re proportioned.</p>\n<p>And, for what it&#x2019;s worth, Food and Western Disease advocates for a paleo diet and doesn&#x2019;t give two darns about macronutrient composition, beyond getting enough protein, even though most paleo blogs treat carbohydrates as the Worst Possible Thing. Also, it convinced me to eat soylent (proper amount of micronutrient to the calorie!) which, from a certain perspective, is literally the furthest thing from paleo. The author, Staffan Lindeberg, has some talks youtube, which are delightfully nerdy and I think would appeal to a lot of commenters here.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T15:59:49.733Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T15:59:49.865Z","PageId":146}},{"id":287,"mentionDate":"1417912680000","createdAt":"2017-05-06T18:36:48.369Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T18:36:48.369Z","BookId":155,"CommentId":275460,"Comment":{"id":275460,"commentUrl":"http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/03/ot10-we-thread-kings/","commentId":"comment-164677","commentTimestamp":"1417912680000","commentAuthor":"zz","commentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVQmPVBjubw\" rel=\"nofollow\">Having micronutrient deficiences will kill you</a>, albeit probably not by 40.</p>\n<p>I subsist exclusively off DIY soylent.

This book is perhaps the best presentation of &#x2018;red&#x2019; ideas I&#x2019;ve seen in a long time. To quote <a href=\"http://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2013/06/america-30.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">my review</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It is unusual for me to read a book aimed at popular conservative audiences.  I am something of a disaffected conservative. Crony capitalism and government overreach have proved to be bipartisan endeavors, and I have long lost faith that the Republican party can ever be more than an organ of America&#x2019;s governing elite. [1] Outside of the beltway the broader currents of mainstream conservatism are so full of angry sound and righteous fury (and nothing else) that I have long stopped paying close attention them. The movement is in desperate need of a clearer vision and more compelling purpose. </p>\n<p> America 3.0 is the book to provide it. </p>\n<p> James Bennet and Michael Lotus get everything right that all of the other popular commentators get wrong. In contrast to pundits incessantly focused on the character flaws of the opposition and controversies of the hour, these authors focus on the broad political principles and broad political context &#x2013; &#x201C;centuries into the past and decades into the future&#x201D; (xxv).  Where most popular political creeds are shallow, filled more with hype and platitudes than meaningful evidence, America 3.0 is both respectful in tone and deeply researched (and none the less readable for it!). Few popular political works have any real historical grounding;  America 3.0 possesses this in spades. Even more impressively, the authors manage to convey both their sense of history and their firm belief in American exceptionalism without any of the reflexive chest-pounding sometimes mistaken as patriotism in conservative corners. (As they write in the introduction, &#x201C;We are attempting to avoid sentimentality in this book, and look at the record in a cold light. As we write things are not good in America. Being realistic is a matter of urgency (xxiv).&#x201D;) Most impressive of all is the political platform they lay out. In age where conservatives are too often defined by what they are against, America 3.0 paints a compelling picture of what they should be for.</p>\n<p>All in all, a breath of fresh air.</p></blockquote>\n<p>When liberal friends ask me for a book that might convince them to switch sides, this is what I give them. As my review says, it gives the reader a grand vision of what a 21st century red tribe is <i>for</i> &#x2014; and by extension, what they think about themselves. </p>\n<p>Hope all that helps.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T16:27:08.242Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T16:27:08.798Z","PageId":465}},{"id":105,"mentionDate":"1479970320000","createdAt":"2017-05-06T18:09:39.204Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T18:09:39.204Z","BookId":352,"CommentId":56239,"Comment":{"id":56239,"commentUrl":"http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/11/23/open-thread-63-25/","commentId":"comment-438301","commentTimestamp":"1479970320000","commentAuthor":"sflicht","commentHtml":"<p>I don&#x2019;t play RPGs, but I wonder if anyone has tried using Kling&#x2019;s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Three-Languages-Politics-Arnold-Kling-ebook/dp/B00CCGF81Q\" rel=\"nofollow\">three-axis system</a> in D&amp;D.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T15:55:54.604Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T15:55:55.296Z","PageId":106}}],"mentionCount":4},{"id":409,"title":"The Wages of Destruction: The Making and Breaking of the Nazi Economy","author":"Adam Tooze","amazonLink":"0143113208","amazonLinkImage":null,"createdAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.649Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.649Z","Mentions":[{"id":158,"mentionDate":"1474082640000","createdAt":"2017-05-06T18:11:52.994Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T18:11:52.994Z","BookId":409,"CommentId":84365,"Comment":{"id":84365,"commentUrl":"http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/09/14/open-thread-58-25/","commentId":"comment-410279","commentTimestamp":"1474082640000","commentAuthor":"cassander","commentHtml":"<p>dndnrsn says:<br>\nSeptember 16, 2016 at 10:23 pm\t~new~</p>\n<p>&gt;Was that already a factor in 1941?

Lend lease is passed in March, initially does not apply to the USSR.  the germans invade at the end of june.  lend lease aid officially begins in october.  So, already, aid in 1941 is limited, and on top of that, much of soviet industry spent the latter half of 1941 being evacuated eastwards.  Much of the early aid also was taken up more in the form of finished goods that were immediately thrown into the fight.  in 42, once the factories are running again, the soviets request more raw material aid.</p>\n<p>&gt;I wonder if there is a specialist history on this topic &#x2013; it would probably require a lot of knowledge of manufacturing, manufacturing history, etc to be able to discuss it really well. I think it is extremely likely that the relatively large number of different models and variants the Germans had didn&#x2019;t help them, but I don&#x2019;t have any hard facts.</p>\n<p>The official book is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Wages-Destruction-Making-Breaking-Economy/dp/0143113208\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wages of Destruction</a>.  It&#x2019;s an extremely fantastic book.  I think it&#x2019;s actually better at the pre-war and early war than the Speer Era, but when I say that I&#x2019;m doing whatever the opposite of damning with faint praise is (praising with faint damnation?).  It very concretely demonstrates that Speer&#x2019;s armaments miracle was largely not of his making, and shows the extent to which the german war economy was limited by hard resource constraints.</p>\n<p>The germans definitely would have been better off with certain economies, and suffered from far too many models of certain vehicles and aircraft which dissipated their engineering capacity and complicated their logistical chains.  That said, you can&#x2019;t just assume that a winnowing down would have selected the right models.   the story of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StG_44\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sturmgewehr </a> is illustrative.

I do not now remember just what the catalyst was &#x2014; lots of stuff going on in my life at the time &#x2014; but I recall thinking, you know, being smart is maybe overrated and there is other stuff that matters a lot.</p>\n<p>Such as being kind.</p>\n<p>It probably had to do with reading <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Impro-Improvisation-Theatre-Keith-Johnstone/dp/0878301178/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Impro</a>. A sample:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nI tried to resist my schooling, but I accepted the idea that my intelligence was the most important part of me. I tried to be *clever* in everything I did. The damage was greatest in areas where my interests and the school&#x2019;s seemed to coincide: in writing, for example (I wrote and rewrote, and lost all my fluency). I forgot that inspiration isn&#x2019;t intellectual, that you don&#x2019;t have to be perfect. In the end I was reluctant to attempt anything for fear of failure, and my first thoughts never seemed good enough. Everything had to be corrected and brought in line.</p>\n<p>The spell broke when I was in my early twenties. I saw a performance of Dovzhenko&#x2019;s <i>Earth</i>, a film which is a closed book for many people, but which threw me into a state of exaltation and confusion. There is a sequence in which the hero, Vassily, walks alone in the twilight. We know he&#x2019;s in danger, and we have just seen him comforting his wife, who rolled her eyes like a frightened animal. There are shots of mist moving eerily on water, and silent horses stretching their necks, and corn-stocks against the dusky sky. Then, amazingly, peasants lying side by side, the men with their hands inside the women&#x2019;s blouses and motionless, with idiotic smiles on their faces as they stare at the twilight. Vassily, dressed in black, walks through the Chagall village, and the dust curls up in little clouds around his feet and he is dark against the moonlit road, and he is filled with the same ecstasy as the peasants. He walks and walks and the film cuts and cuts until he walks out of frame. Then the camera moves back, and we see him stop. The fact that he walks for so long, and that the image is so beautiful, linked up with my own experience of being alone in the twilight&#x2014;the gap between the worlds. Then Vassily walks again, but after a short time he begins to dance, and the dance is skilled, and like an act of thanksgiving. The dust swirls around his feet, so that he&#x2019;s like an Indian god, like Siva&#x2014;and with the man dancing alone in the clouds of dust something unlocked in me. In one moment I knew that the valuing of men by their intelligence is crazy, and that peasants watching the night sky might feel more than I feel, and that the man who dances might be superior to myself&#x2014;word-bound and unable to dance. From then on I noticed how warped people of great intelligence are, and I began to value people for their actions, rather than their thoughts.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>I still think intelligence is enormously valuable. I&#x2019;m a math geek after all. But it can become a trap.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T16:27:43.666Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T16:27:44.841Z","PageId":478}},{"id":143,"mentionDate":"1461066180000","createdAt":"2017-05-06T18:11:18.966Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T18:11:18.966Z","BookId":110,"CommentId":141645,"Comment":{"id":141645,"commentUrl":"http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/04/15/links-416-they-cant-link-our-dick/","commentId":"comment-348054","commentTimestamp":"1461066180000","commentAuthor":"<a href=\"http://robertliguoriwritesstuff.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"external nofollow\" class=\"url\">Robert Liguori</a>","commentHtml":"<p>I can&#x2019;t point you at any academic works, but as far as I can tell, the term in its current internet usage originated from<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Impro-Improvisation-Theatre-Keith-Johnstone/dp/0878301178\" rel=\"nofollow\">Impro, by Keith Johnstone</a>.</p>\n<p>Anyone have any other point-of-origin references?</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T16:08:10.871Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T16:08:12.530Z","PageId":221}}],"mentionCount":3},{"id":361,"title":"Mindset: The New Psychology of Success","author":"Carol S.

The feeling that you can always eke out more with the right inducement is an illusion. Eventually one more straw will in fact break a camel&#x2019;s back. As for willpower&#x2026; With the right inducement (say, continued employment) you can exert superhuman willpower, like waking up early and going to work every day for years or decades. Which is to say that with the right incentives, willpower doesn&#x2019;t even need to be invoked. So maybe I&#x2019;m saying that it doesn&#x2019;t matter if willpower is unlimited, you can route around it and find creative ways to induce yourself to do what you really want to do.</p>\n<p>Dammit, I degenerated immediately to pitching Beeminder again!</p>\n<p>But to finish the thought, as I&#x2019;ve argued in the comments above, the best way to use Beeminder, at least initially, is not to probe the hard limits of willpower but to fix egregious instances of akrasia &#x2014; to do a bit more than the bupkes you&#x2019;d do if left to your own devices. You can then gradually dial up the steepness of your graph, but certainly stop doing that before feeling overwhelmed by stress and anxiety.</p>\n<p>In other words, make a measurable improvement well below the point that the limits of willpower are even a question (if you don&#x2019;t think of it as routing around willpower altogether). Some people &#x2014; like the productivity-ueber-alles types who try polyphasic sleep and whatnot &#x2014; thrive on adding stress and Beeminder can accommodate that. But using it in moderation can reduce stress, like by getting you to spread your studying out over a semester instead of cramming for exams, or by making you pay attention to your fitbit just enough to actually get in 10k steps a day, or getting yourself to bed on time instead of repeatedly getting in &#x201C;one more point&#x201D; in a comment thread till 2am.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T16:23:22.956Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T16:23:23.128Z","PageId":394}},{"id":55,"mentionDate":"1463676900000","createdAt":"2017-05-06T18:08:22.742Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T18:08:22.742Z","BookId":361,"CommentId":128874,"Comment":{"id":128874,"commentUrl":"http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/05/19/teachers-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/","commentId":"comment-360714","commentTimestamp":"1463676900000","commentAuthor":"Jill","commentHtml":"<p>There are ways to teach something very much like  &#x201C;grit&#x201D; to children and also to adults.</p>\n<p>I hate the title of this book, but I just assume that the author&#x2019;s publisher made up the title to try to sell more copies.

For examples, in the 1960s one study of over 100 alcoholics found that half of the high-dose LSD treatment participants reported abstinence 6 months after treatment, in comparison with one-third of those in a low-dose LSD group and only 12% in a conventionally treated group. Other research in the 1960s indicated that a majority of cancer patients suffering from anxiety, depression, and uncontrollable pain showed improvement in their physical and emotional status after LSD treatment. The researchers also observed that many of these LSD-treated patients reported that their desire for addictive pain medicines, such as morphine, diminished or vanished, along with the pain. In fact, at that time the National Institute of Mental Health recognized that the use of LSD in these types of patients was legitimate.</p>\n<p>This LSD therapy phase began to wane in the mid-1960s for two primary reasons. First, the psychiatric community was unable to decide how LSD should be used in the therapeutic process or to document its efficacy scientifically. Second, but the mid-1960s, nonmedical use of LSD, especially by young people comprising a counterculture that was opposed to traditional values (&#x201C;hippies&#x201D;), led to the belief that LSD had become a public health problem. As a result the U.S. government passed a law that banned the use and sale of LSD, as well as peyote, mescaline, and several similar drugs, by the public. At that point, legitimate research on its effects on humans and on its potential therapeutic uses declined precipitously&#x2014;not only because of the legal difficulties and maze of bureaucratic procedures required, but also because psychedelic research with humans was not viewed as reputable by the vast majority of those in the scientific community.</p>\n<p>In this third phase, LSD and similar drugs became just another class of abusable drugs that mainstream culture attempted to suppress. Psychedelic drug therapy still goes on unofficially&#x2014;practitioners would not continue using it under difficult conditions unless they believed that they were accomplishing something.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T16:24:15.144Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T16:24:15.793Z","PageId":410}}],"mentionCount":2},{"id":36,"title":"The Food Lab: Better Home Cooking Through Science","author":"J.

The style is classic American, but the recipes in the book are largely extremely complicated, such as a Chili requiring 40 ingredients and 3 days preparation. However, I&#x2019;d still say its very useful for a beginner since the recipes themselves are only a small part of the book; much of it is instead braking down the science behind the recipes and why the various extra ingredients work, which means you can basically just pick out a few innovations and put them into much simpler variations. There are also a lot of guides to things like knife skills, choosing meat and vegetables, deep frying, etc. That being said, the total number of recipes does end up being a little small, so it works best in conjunction with another cookbook so you have more potential dishes to apply the lessons to.</p>\n<p>For the former I&#x2019;d say it very much depends on what kind of food you like or where you are; I presume you&#x2019;re an American and looking for an American guide, which I couldn&#x2019;t offer.

Thinking back, I believe I may have been requested to prove this more than once here.  Not something I&#x2019;m really interested in myself, but apparently it is very important to at least one or two of the devotees of Saint Ayn.  Although I&#x2019;ve read The Virtue of Selfishness by Ayn Rand  and Nathaniel Branden, years ago, I certainly am not willing to go back and read all 173 pages of it now.</p>\n<p>But I noticed there is a wikipedia written about the book and about how Rand uses the term &#x201C;selfishness&#x201D; within it.  And I am quite willing to read that, in order to acquaint myself with something that is of apparent great importance to one or more persons here. </p>\n<p>&#x201C;Rand acknowledged in the book&#x2019;s introduction that the term &#x2018;selfishness&#x2019; was not typically used to describe virtuous behavior, but insisted that her usage was consistent with a more precise meaning of the term as simply &#x201C;concern with one&#x2019;s own interests.&#x201D; The equation of selfishness with evil, Rand said, had caused &#x201C;the arrested moral development of mankind&#x201D; and needed to be rejected.[5]&#x201D;</p>\n<p>My own view is that &#x201C;selfish&#x201D; is one of those words like &#x201C;love&#x201D; that sure means a lot of different things to a lot of different people.  The 2 meanings that are most problematic in my view are 1) the meaning that makes concern with one&#x2019;s own interests always a virtue i.e, the meaning that Paul Ryan and other people who worship at the Church of Neoliberal Economics (AKA the First Church of Ayn) give to the word and 2) the meaning that makes concern with one&#x2019;s own interests always a flaw.  </p>\n<p>In my view, taking care of one&#x2019;s own best interests is a virtue, as long as you don&#x2019;t cause unnecessary harm to others such as e.g. killing them, robbing them or poisoning their air, water, food etc.&#x2013; EVEN IF you have no intention of doing these things, and no knowledge that you have done them.  Even if you are the CEO who has surrounded yourself with Yes Men and Yes Women, because they know how to help you make money for your business, and know how to lobby Congress for regulatory capture by your company, and know how to not bother you with the gory details of who was harmed in the process and how.  </p>\n<p>So selfishness, or concern with one&#x2019;s own interests, in my view, can be either a virtue or a flaw&#x2013; depending on how you do it.</p>\n<p>I disagree with Rand about many things, and I agree with her about some things.  I certainly agree that various forms of unselfishness can also be either a virtue or a flaw.  Psychotherapists refer to the type of unselfishness that is a flaw, as being &#x201C;codependent&#x201D;, or being an &#x201C;enabler&#x201D;, where you help people so much that you drain yourself unnecessarily, and/or you encourage them in alcoholism or other behavior through which they weaken themselves.  </p>\n<p>Both the kind of selfishness that is a flaw, and the kind of unselfishness that is a flaw contribute greatly to societal, economic and political problems, in addition to being individual personal problems for people.  </p>\n<p>I wish that our society could become less ideological so that we could address all of those kinds of problems and improve our ways of doing things so that they are more just and fair than they are now.</p>\n<p>But we&#x2019;re very polarized now, so that is not possible yet.  And part of the polarization is the Selfishness is Always the Highest Virtue church vs. the Selfishness is Always the Worst Evil Church.  </p>\n<p>And so far&#x2013; Never the twain shall meet.</p>\n<p>I would very much like the twain to meet though.  I think that would be great if the twain would meet.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T16:00:23.863Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T16:00:24.738Z","PageId":153}}],"mentionCount":2},{"id":103,"title":"The Holocaust in American Life","author":"Peter Novick","amazonLink":"0618082328","amazonLinkImage":null,"createdAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.609Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.609Z","Mentions":[{"id":306,"mentionDate":"1465084200000","createdAt":"2017-05-06T18:44:47.525Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T18:44:47.525Z","BookId":103,"CommentId":122876,"Comment":{"id":122876,"commentUrl":"http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/06/02/links-616-linkandescence/","commentId":"comment-368442","commentTimestamp":"1465084200000","commentAuthor":"NN","commentHtml":"<blockquote><p>Maybe.

During WWII, reports of Nazi concentration camps came after years of reports of Axis atrocities, so they weren&#x2019;t nearly as shocking to people back then as they are to people who are introduced to them without context today. Initial reports were also a bit confused as to the nature of the Holocaust: most wartime news articles and broadcasts about Nazi concentration camps described them as &#x201C;camps where the Nazis have placed political prisoners, a disproportionate number of whom are Jews and other ethnic minorities,&#x201D; in large part because most of the camps that the American and British forces liberated did contain large numbers of political prisoners. The camps where most of the Jewish victims were killed were liberated by the Soviets, far away from the eyes of Western reporters.</p>\n<p>After WWII, the Holocaust was downplayed in the US in significant part due to Cold War politics. It was critical that West-Germany be rebuilt and re-armed in order to prevent the Soviets from expanding further West, so focusing on German atrocities too much would have been very politically inconvenient. This still has significant effects today: notice how even modern American WWII movies rarely mention the Eastern Front.</p>\n<p>All of this changed in the 1960s and 1970s for complicated reasons, including the 1961 Eichmann trial and the rise of identity politics in the 1960s. Note that as late as 1963, when Martin Luther King Jr. brought up Hitler in his &#x201C;Letter from a Birmingham Jail,&#x201D; he immediately followed references to the Nazis with references to the Soviets: &#x201C;We should never forget that everything Adolf Hitler did in Germany was &#x2018;legal&#x2019; and everything the Hungarian freedom fighters did in Hungary was &#x2018;illegal.&#x2019; It was &#x2018;illegal&#x2019; to aid and comfort a Jew in Hitler&#x2019;s Germany. Even so, I am sure that, had I lived in Germany at the time, I would have aided and comforted my Jewish brothers. If today I lived in a Communist country where certain principles dear to the Christian faith are suppressed, I would openly advocate disobeying that country&#x2019;s antireligious laws.&#x201D; It&#x2019;s hard to imagine someone saying something like that today. A side note: I thought for more than a decade that this letter&#x2019;s reference to &#x201C;the Hungarian freedom fighters&#x201D; referred to Hungarian partisans during WWII, until I read about the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Revolution_of_1956\" rel=\"nofollow\">1956 Hungarian Revolution</a>.</p>\n<p>So we may not actually know who the next Hitler is until some 20-30 years after his/her crimes.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T16:08:26.180Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T16:08:28.700Z","PageId":223}}],"mentionCount":2},{"id":50,"title":"Academically Adrift: Limited Learning on College Campuses","author":"Richard Arum","amazonLink":"0226028569","amazonLinkImage":null,"createdAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.604Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.604Z","Mentions":[{"id":322,"mentionDate":"1422837900000","createdAt":"2017-05-06T18:56:49.236Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T18:56:49.236Z","BookId":50,"CommentId":262332,"Comment":{"id":262332,"commentUrl":"http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/31/the-parable-of-the-talents/","commentId":"comment-179283","commentTimestamp":"1422837900000","commentAuthor":"Anonymous","commentHtml":"<p>@David</p>\n<p>I&#x2019;ve been wondering the same thing for a while.</p>\n<p>-My understanding of education history (which comes entirely from Sal Khan&#x2019;s book) is that there&#x2019;s a several-hundred century gap in between &#x201C;printing press&#x201D; and &#x201C;textbooks legitimate alternative to lecture&#x201D;; the latter happened (without checking my notes) no more than 250 years ago.</p>\n<p>-Educational institutions (which is where most academic learning happens for most people, regardless of their efficacy) don&#x2019;t really optimize for learning. And why should they? Professors don&#x2019;t benefit if their students learn more (they benefit from offering easy classes because that gets them good reviews [<a href=\"http://smile.amazon.com/Academically-Adrift-Limited-Learning-Campuses/dp/0226028569?sa-no-redirect=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">1</a>]). Students don&#x2019;t benefit from institutions where they learn more (they benefit from high grades at high-reputation institutions. If an institution could quadruple the rate at which student learning happened for a 1% increase in student effort, the typical grade-optimizing student wouldn&#x2019;t be against it, because quadruple the material means quadruple the amount on the test, so they&#x2019;re expending 1% more effort for the same grade. See also: students who celebrate when class is canceled.) College administrators certainly aren&#x2019;t optimizing for learning (they benefit from an institution that&#x2019;s perceived as more elite, which has little to do with learning, because otherwise elite universities would be unusually good at teaching. I have a friend at Harvard who does well in classes where he&#x2019;s learned nothing. Also, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuY7szYSXSw\" rel=\"nofollow\">this guy</a>. Also, <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/08/certified-teach.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a></p>\n<p>-A lot of the psychological research which impinges on learning is fairly recent (past 60 years or so; see, for instance, the list of citations <a href=\"http://www.gwern.net/Spaced%20repetition\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>), and hasn&#x2019;t managed to work it&#x2019;s way into education systems that do very little to optimize for learning.</p>\n<p>-That style of teaching <i>is</i> disappearing, albeit slowly. See, for instance, App Academy, Rob Rhineheart learning biochemistry fairly quickly, Eliezer Yudkowsky doing mathematical research without so much as a GRE, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duolingo#Duolingo_for_Schools\" rel=\"nofollow\">Duolingo being incorporated into shools</a>. It&#x2019;s happening slowly, and almost entirely outside of the traditional systems (K&#x2013;12, college), but it&#x2019;s there.</p>\n<p>-Organizational inertia. Combination of &#x201C;this was how the last generation learned it, it worked, why are we changing?&#x201D; and &#x201C;I [the professor] am the best in the world at X, this is how I learned X, therefore it&#x2019;s the best way to learn X&#x201D; and even &#x201C;I&#x2019;m the best in the world at X and I learned it successfully this way, therefore everyone else should be able to learn it this way.&#x201D; (It really hasn&#x2019;t helped that most of the relevant research has been done sometime between when current professors took the classes they&#x2019;re teaching and are teaching the classes they&#x2019;re teaching.)</p>\n<p>-Getting good at learning is seen as low status. There was an Overcoming Bias post the this effect that I can&#x2019;t find, but the overwhelming attitude I&#x2019;ve encountered is that, if you&#x2019;re actually smart, then you don&#x2019;t need to optimize your learning strategies, so looking into how to be a more effective learning is a tacit admission that you&#x2019;re not actually smart (to the point that students will brag about how little they studied, because getting a B with no work means you&#x2019;re smarter than someone who got an A with a lot of work.) Thus, universities don&#x2019;t reward professors for looking to become better teachers, and, to some degree, even punish them; my sister had a really great physics professor who was denied tenure for so long he left his position because he was studying physics education (low status) rather than physics (high status).</p>\n<p>In summary: Textbooks are better than lecture for learning, but schools still utilize lecture because they have little incentive to make more learning happen. Alternatives that produce better outcomes have been identified and are starting to displace traditional education, but the research leading to them is recent enough we haven&#x2019;t seen this happen to any significant degree&#x2026; yet. However, ceter paribus, a student who&#x2019;s successfully learned stuff is going to outcompete a student who hasn&#x2019;t, so traditional institutions will eventually either adapt or die.</p>\n<p>Suntzuanime also makes a good point.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T16:24:38.407Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T16:24:39.029Z","PageId":416}},{"id":111,"mentionDate":"1422448020000","createdAt":"2017-05-06T18:09:50.513Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T18:09:50.513Z","BookId":50,"CommentId":263860,"Comment":{"id":263860,"commentUrl":"http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/27/ot13-thread-the-blood-of-angry-men/","commentId":"comment-177941","commentTimestamp":"1422448020000","commentAuthor":"zz","commentHtml":"<p>School choice is hard to measure because there&#x2019;s no obvious metric.

[3] The authors agree with this sentiment, but go much further than I have, suggesting a  series of reforms that move talk of decentralization from the realm of abstract political principle to concrete action. The book is worth reading for these twenty pages on decentralization alone.  <b> Key to the program is the goal to &#x201C;push as many contentious issues as possible to the most basic local level as possible, and then reducing the transaction costs as low as possible (229).&#x201D;</b> In other words, let each community decide its own policy on social issues but make it as easy as possible for people to switch from one community to another. If state senators in Connecticut want to ban the ownership of assault rifles &#x2013; let them! If a small town in Utah wants to require every teacher to carry a gun with them to school &#x2013; let them! If you do not like the policies in your community, move to somewhere new.

It is probably the best example of what a political track <i>can</i> be. Its analysis stretches hundreds of years into the past and several decades into the future and is better researched than any of the more popular tracts pushed on talk radio programs.

This book is perhaps the best presentation of &#x2018;red&#x2019; ideas I&#x2019;ve seen in a long time. To quote <a href=\"http://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2013/06/america-30.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">my review</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It is unusual for me to read a book aimed at popular conservative audiences.  I am something of a disaffected conservative. Crony capitalism and government overreach have proved to be bipartisan endeavors, and I have long lost faith that the Republican party can ever be more than an organ of America&#x2019;s governing elite. [1] Outside of the beltway the broader currents of mainstream conservatism are so full of angry sound and righteous fury (and nothing else) that I have long stopped paying close attention them. The movement is in desperate need of a clearer vision and more compelling purpose. </p>\n<p> America 3.0 is the book to provide it. </p>\n<p> James Bennet and Michael Lotus get everything right that all of the other popular commentators get wrong. In contrast to pundits incessantly focused on the character flaws of the opposition and controversies of the hour, these authors focus on the broad political principles and broad political context &#x2013; &#x201C;centuries into the past and decades into the future&#x201D; (xxv).  Where most popular political creeds are shallow, filled more with hype and platitudes than meaningful evidence, America 3.0 is both respectful in tone and deeply researched (and none the less readable for it!). Few popular political works have any real historical grounding;  America 3.0 possesses this in spades. Even more impressively, the authors manage to convey both their sense of history and their firm belief in American exceptionalism without any of the reflexive chest-pounding sometimes mistaken as patriotism in conservative corners. (As they write in the introduction, &#x201C;We are attempting to avoid sentimentality in this book, and look at the record in a cold light. As we write things are not good in America. Being realistic is a matter of urgency (xxiv).&#x201D;) Most impressive of all is the political platform they lay out. In age where conservatives are too often defined by what they are against, America 3.0 paints a compelling picture of what they should be for.</p>\n<p>All in all, a breath of fresh air.</p></blockquote>\n<p>When liberal friends ask me for a book that might convince them to switch sides, this is what I give them. As my review says, it gives the reader a grand vision of what a 21st century red tribe is <i>for</i> &#x2014; and by extension, what they think about themselves. </p>\n<p>Hope all that helps.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T16:27:08.242Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T16:27:08.798Z","PageId":465}}],"mentionCount":2},{"id":75,"title":"Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America","author":"Barbara Ehrenreich","amazonLink":"0312626681","amazonLinkImage":null,"createdAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.607Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.607Z","Mentions":[{"id":323,"mentionDate":"1473366360000","createdAt":"2017-05-06T18:56:52.204Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T18:56:52.204Z","BookId":75,"CommentId":86823,"Comment":{"id":86823,"commentUrl":"http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/09/07/open-thread-57-75/","commentId":"comment-406802","commentTimestamp":"1473366360000","commentAuthor":"Jill","commentHtml":"<p>Sharing of beds and rooms, in a society like the current U.S., where it is seen as fairly acceptable to be inconsiderate, self-centered, irresponsible etc., could be so  problematic that I don&#x2019;t think most people would wish it on their worst enemy.

The style is classic American, but the recipes in the book are largely extremely complicated, such as a Chili requiring 40 ingredients and 3 days preparation. However, I&#x2019;d still say its very useful for a beginner since the recipes themselves are only a small part of the book; much of it is instead braking down the science behind the recipes and why the various extra ingredients work, which means you can basically just pick out a few innovations and put them into much simpler variations. There are also a lot of guides to things like knife skills, choosing meat and vegetables, deep frying, etc. That being said, the total number of recipes does end up being a little small, so it works best in conjunction with another cookbook so you have more potential dishes to apply the lessons to.</p>\n<p>For the former I&#x2019;d say it very much depends on what kind of food you like or where you are; I presume you&#x2019;re an American and looking for an American guide, which I couldn&#x2019;t offer.

This is documented in an excellent work, <i><a href=\"http://smile.amazon.com/Island-at-Center-World-ebook/dp/B000FCK2Z6/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1462196643&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=island+in+the+middle+of+the+world\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Island at the Center of the World</a></i> by Russell Shorto, who argues that the uniquely American character of deal-making and &#x201C;everything&#x2019;s negotiable&#x201D; comes to us from the Dutch. He also argues&#x2013;with considerable merit in my view&#x2013;that the Dutch also brought many cultural influences which led to the strongly democratic tendencies we see in America: unlike, say, the Quakers, who (as you and Fischer describe them above) paid a great deal of lip service to the concept of equality, but who kicked the Borderers out of town when they got too rowdy, the Dutch of New Amsterdam (their name for present-day New York) actually practiced it: the New Amsterdam of its hey day was a city of whites, blacks, Indians, and every possible combination of the above&#x2013;and all competing&#x2013;squabbling, arguing, fighting&#x2013;as equals in a marketplace where all were welcome so long as they had something to offer.</p>\n<p>A few other comments, in no particular order:</p>\n<p>1. The Democratic-Republicans had NOTHING to do with the modern-day Republicans. Or everything, but then also with the modern-day Democrats. They were, for a time&#x2013;basically from the collapse of the Federalist Party in the early 1800s to the breakdown of the Democratic-Republicans into Whigs and Democrats in the 1820s, the so-called &#x201C;Era of Good Feelings&#x201D;&#x2013;the ONLY political party extant in the United States, and as such, you can argue they were the progenitors of all the rest. But the reality is that the original Republican Party of the 1850s and 1860s picked up most of the pieces of the old Whig Party and some of the Northern bits of the Democratic Party to assemble into a coalition that was centered around&#x2013;as their slogans would have it&#x2013;&#x201C;Free Soil and Free Men&#x201D;, in contradistinction to the Democratic Party, which was increasingly defined by its unwavering commitment to maintaining the &#x201C;Peculiar Institution&#x201D; as slavery was often called (note for moderns: &#x201C;peculiar&#x201D; in that era meant &#x201C;specific to&#x201D; rather than &#x201C;odd&#x201D; as we might nowadays think).</p>\n<p>2. Trying to connect the underlying views of the early settlers to modern PARTISAN divisions is hopelessly wrong: rather, you need to look past the party labels and focus on the ideological and philosophical differences. If you look at county-by-county maps of today&#x2019;s partisan alignments you will find they are almost exactly the negative image of the partisan alignments of a century ago, when the South and West were largely DEMOCRATIC areas (except for the West Coast, where the coastal areas were predominantly Republican) and New England, the Mid-Atlantic region and the Midwest were largely REPUBLICAN. But if you look past the party labels you can discern some interesting connections.</p>\n<p>3. The Michigan experience you reference is far from unique. In his important work, <i><a href=\"http://smile.amazon.com/Emerging-Republican-Majority-American-Politics-ebook/dp/B00M5JXUHO/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1462198047&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=emerging+republican+majority\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Emerging Republican Majority</a></i>, Kevin Phillips shows that migration patterns in the United States&#x2013;with one important exception&#x2013;were from East to West <b>along essentially the same lines of latitude</b>. So northwestern areas like Michigan, Minnesota, Washington and Oregon tended to be settled by people from New England (Portland, Oregon was named after Portland, Maine, and could as easily have been named for Boston, Mass) and the mid-Atlantic&#x2013;i.e. Puritans and Quakers&#x2013;whereas more southwestern areas&#x2013;Arizona, New Mexico, and southern California&#x2013;tended to be settled by Southerners&#x2013;Cavaliers and Borderers. The notable exception? The Great Migrations of blacks, which as one might guess went from South to North: we think of blacks as being largely an urban people, but in reality, until the 1920s, most blacks lived in the rural South (gee, I wonder why?).</p>\n<p>4. Northern New England was both heavily Republican and conservative until the last half-century, when the native population was numerically overwhelmed by the in-migration of Bostonians (to southern New Hampshire) and New Yorkers and others (to Vermont and Maine). As these were smaller states to begin with, much of the remaining &#x201C;footprint&#x201D; of the original settlers is now confined to the relatively inaccessible and rural parts of these states. You also see this happening&#x2013;albeit to a lesser degree&#x2013;in some of the Mountain states, e.g. Arizona (huge influx of retirees), New Mexico (huge influx of &#x201C;alternate&#x201D; cultist types) and Colorado (huge influx of urbanites of all sorts). Notice however that Utah, Idaho and Wyoming seem to have been much less susceptible, possibly on account of the large Mormon footprint in those states.</p>\n<p>I could add a few other things but those are the big ones. I could also give you some suggestions as to how to disentangle things, but that&#x2019;s an entirely new topic, so I&#x2019;ll let it go! &#x1F642;</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T16:07:45.119Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T16:07:46.927Z","PageId":219}}],"mentionCount":1},{"id":49,"title":"The Economic Laws of Scientific Research","author":"Terence Kealey","amazonLink":"0312173067","amazonLinkImage":null,"createdAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.604Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.604Z","Mentions":[{"id":67,"mentionDate":"1472586300000","createdAt":"2017-05-06T18:08:31.067Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T18:08:31.067Z","BookId":49,"CommentId":90588,"Comment":{"id":90588,"commentUrl":"http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/08/28/ot57-chopin-thread/","commentId":"comment-403714","commentTimestamp":"1472586300000","commentAuthor":"<a href=\"http://www.daviddfriedman.com\" rel=\"external nofollow\" class=\"url\">David Friedman</a>","commentHtml":"<p>Three comments on the subject of government funding of basic research:</p>\n<p>Terence Kealey <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Economic-Laws-Scientific-Research/dp/0312173067\" rel=\"nofollow\">offers evidence</a> that it doesn&#x2019;t result in increased progress, using cases where government funding sharply increased at a specific time.</p>\n<p>2.

My impression was that the result was to attract more very smart people into that field and out of other areas of research than the field could use. </p>\n<p>So far as I can tell, in the forty some years since I left the field it has produced little knowledge that is of actual use, despite the large number of very smart people working in it. The big progress has come in areas that, at the time I entered graduate school (1965), were much less in fashion and, I would guess, much less subsidized.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T16:00:36.162Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T16:00:37.549Z","PageId":155}}],"mentionCount":1},{"id":4,"title":"Constitutional Law: Principles and Policies","author":"Erwin Chemerinsky","amazonLink":"1454849479","amazonLinkImage":null,"createdAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.592Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.592Z","Mentions":[{"id":156,"mentionDate":"1463870520000","createdAt":"2017-05-06T18:11:47.136Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T18:11:47.136Z","BookId":4,"CommentId":129328,"Comment":{"id":129328,"commentUrl":"http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/05/18/open-thread-49-75/","commentId":"comment-361551","commentTimestamp":"1463870520000","commentAuthor":"Anonymous","commentHtml":"<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/ol/1454849479/ref=olp_tab_used?ie=UTF8&amp;condition=used\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/ol/1454849479/ref=olp_tab_used?ie=UTF8&amp;condition=used</a></p>\n<p>This is a good con law hornbook.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T16:06:40.528Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T16:06:41.146Z","PageId":209}}],"mentionCount":1},{"id":52,"title":"The Handbook of Self-Healing: Your Personal Program for Better Health and Increased Vitality","author":"Meir Schneider","amazonLink":"0140193316","amazonLinkImage":null,"createdAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.605Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.605Z","Mentions":[{"id":265,"mentionDate":"1487267220000","createdAt":"2017-05-06T18:30:16.880Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T18:30:16.880Z","BookId":52,"CommentId":27369,"Comment":{"id":27369,"commentUrl":"http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/02/15/open-thread-69-25/","commentId":"comment-468028","commentTimestamp":"1487267220000","commentAuthor":"Nancy Lebovitz","commentHtml":"<p>I&#x2019;d go with foot massage/joint mobility.</p>\n<p>If you&#x2019;re feeling ambitous for your feet, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Handbook-Self-Healing-Personal-Increased-Vitality/dp/0140193316/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Handbook of Self-Healing</a> by Meier Schneider has a lot about increasing sensitivity and mobility for your feet, and getting independent movement for your toes in particular.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T15:51:57.029Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T15:51:57.512Z","PageId":52}}],"mentionCount":1},{"id":53,"title":"You are Now Less Dumb: How to Conquer Mob Mentality, How to Buy Happiness, and All the Other Ways to Outsmart Yourself","author":"David McRaney","amazonLink":"1592408796","amazonLinkImage":null,"createdAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.605Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.605Z","Mentions":[{"id":35,"mentionDate":"1483046400000","createdAt":"2017-05-06T18:08:07.329Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T18:08:07.329Z","BookId":53,"CommentId":46855,"Comment":{"id":46855,"commentUrl":"http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/12/29/book-review-mount-misery/","commentId":"comment-448248","commentTimestamp":"1483046400000","commentAuthor":"Moon","commentHtml":"<p>Some schools of psychotherapy that are not very evidence based or research based, are not that different from religion.  You have a belief system.  You believe it without evidence and/or you make up the evidence as you go along, in the way that you interpret events in your (or your patient&#x2019;s) life within the framework of your belief system.  And you are clueless as to how subjective this all is.</p>\n<p>Belief systems seem rational to people.  But really they are just big security blankets, or life preservers, to satisfy one&#x2019;s needs for emotional security, and for certainty.  Through them, you know exactly the right or virtuous action to take in any situation.  You know exactly how to be an expert in your profession, even if you just read your very first book about it.  </p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s an accident of history that the highest status psychotherapists are psychiatrists, in the current system.  Although there are exceptions to the rule, the average psychologist or social worker usually knows more about how to do psychotherapy than the average psychiatrist does, for a number of reasons. These reasons include not suffering much from sleep deprivation during training, as psychiatrists do; not having most of their training be about medicine rather than psychology; and being more grounded and sensitive, on average, due to having lower status and less power.   </p>\n<p>There are some advantages that psychiatrists do have though, such as knowing how to prescribe medications when needed, and being able to recognize it more easily when the supposed mental disorder is actually a physical disorder.         </p>\n<p>Belief systems must be very necessary for humans, because they are everywhere, and some of them even successfully charge super high prices for entry.  </p>\n<p>There is the rationalist belief system.  Rationalists really think they are being logical and rational while they nit pick, cherry pick, lemon pick etc.</p>\n<p>There is the Right Wing ideological system so common on this board when politics comes up.  To me this looks and feels exactly like a Right Wing Safe Space and echo chamber bubble.  But to most participants on this board, who are Right Wing themselves, I am sure that the board appears to be rational and objective.  </p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s hard to see a belief system objectively, when you are inside of it.</p>\n<p>One giant overarching belief seems to be a belief in black/white thinking.  And there is lots of that in our culture.  E.g. if you think the job of psychotherapist has to never require an M.D. or always require one.  If you have to always talk at the object level or always at the meta level.  Or if you have to always piss off your patients, or always be nice to them.  If you have to only  be open to a patient and connect with them as a human vs. if you have to always be practically a robot in your dispensation of medication or advice or response to patient&#x2019;s words with particular techniques.    </p>\n<p>Some therapists, and patients, seem to be caught within such black/white frameworks.  But psychotherapy is actually as large as human life, human needs, and the meanings humans give to their lives, and the traumas and other experiences that humans have and their effects.  That&#x2019;s why so many therapists run screaming and then look to find their certainty in rigid belief systems.  </p>\n<p>And the great variety of things that different patients need mean that it can be difficult for a patient to find a good match in a therapist.  If the therapist is all empathy, and you need direction or challenge&#x2014;or vice versa&#x2014;then you need to find someone who is a better match.  </p>\n<p>Sometimes you can do this by phone by asking what kinds of interventions the therapist does to help their patients.  And of course, some therapists can both challenge a patient and give empathy, as needed.  But there is an interpersonal chemistry involved, where some therapist/patient duos are great matches, and others do not work at all.  </p>\n<p>The same for therapy groups and support groups.  AA is some people&#x2019;s wonderful solution, and other people&#x2019;s pointless exercise in futility, depending on their needs and also on the other personalities present in the group.  Interestingly, some of the best AA groups contain people who have been through a lot of psychotherapy themselves.     </p>\n<p>One psychology professor I once had, asked me &#x201C;How can you be aware of what&#x2019;s not there?&#x201D;  When he asked me, I didn&#x2019;t know the answer, nor did he.  But now I think I know.  You are aware of what&#x2019;s not there, from experience&#x2013; your own, your patients&#x2019; experiences, the experiences of the people around you.  You can tell what is missing when things aren&#x2019;t going well for a patient, by observing what is present when things ARE working well for people in their lives.    </p>\n<p>Cognitive distortions come into play in schools of psychotherapy, as in much of life.  There are interesting books written about cognitive distortions, like </p>\n<p>You Are Not So Smart: Why You Have Too Many Friends on Facebook, Why Your Memory Is Mostly Fiction, an d 46 Other Ways You&#x2019;re Deluding Yourself Paperback &#x2013; November 6, 2012<br>\nby David McRaney</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/You-Are-Not-So-Smart/dp/1592407366/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483029059&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=you+are+now+less+dumb\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.amazon.com/You-Are-Not-So-Smart/dp/1592407366/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483029059&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=you+are+now+less+dumb</a></p>\n<p>You are Now Less Dumb: How to Conquer Mob Mentality, How to Buy Happiness, and All the Other Ways to Outsmart Yourself Paperback &#x2013; August 5, 2014<br>\nby David McRaney </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/You-are-Now-Less-Dumb/dp/1592408796/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483029059&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=you+are+now+less+dumb\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.amazon.com/You-are-Now-Less-Dumb/dp/1592408796/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483029059&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=you+are+now+less+dumb</a></p>\n<p>One of the distortions covered in this latter book here is deindividuation, through which, despite our best intentions, we pretty much disappear when subsumed by a mob mentality.</p>\n<p>People think of mobs as big angry crowds outdoors.  But the group of people in one&#x2019;s professional training program can be a sort of mob&#x2013; and indeed is more powerful, for a longer time, over the individual than your typical mob.  You can&#x2019;t just walk away and go back home in an hour&#x2013; not if you really want the degree or the professional license you are pursuing.</p>\n<p>Many schools of psychology are religion and are also power politics&#x2013; due to the power that supervisors have over trainees, and the power that trainees and other therapists have over vulnerable and sick patients.  To use power appropriately and for good, rather than for evil, or rather than for getting hopelessly lost with your power  and not having any idea what the impact of your own behavior is, is a challenge that few humans seem to be capable of dealing with well. </p>\n<p>Not going along with the prevailing belief system can put one in a really bad position.  So many people just chime in and go along to get along&#x2013; patients, psychotherapist trainees, people whose families or friends or colleagues or favorite Internet board all lean the same way politically etc. </p>\n<p>My favorite book that I have read in a long time proposes an overall framework for therapists, parents, teachers, spouses, leaders of all kinds etc., in their work.  I am seldom impressed by a book, but this one has some good points.  The writer uses Bowen&#x2019;s family systems therapy as the basis for his theories, explained here below in wikipedia.  Although I do not believe every word of Bowen&#x2019;s theory, I find much of it useful. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bowen\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bowen</a>    </p>\n<p>The book I mentioned above, that is based on Bowen&#x2019;s theory, is A Failure of Nerve: Leadership in the Age of the Quick Fix Paperback &#x2013; February 1, 2007 by Edwin H. Friedman.  The author is dead, but somehow a new edition of the book is coming out in May of this year, so there must be people thinking it is still relevant, and apparently editors adding something to it.  I don&#x2019;t agree with everything in the book, but do with a lot of it.  Even where I disagree, it stimulates my thinking.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Failure-Nerve-Leadership-Age-Quick/dp/159627042X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483030635&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=A+Failure+of+Nerve\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.amazon.com/Failure-Nerve-Leadership-Age-Quick/dp/159627042X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483030635&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=A+Failure+of+Nerve</a></p>\n<p>From the summary on Amazaon: &#x201C;he argues for strength and self-differentiation as the marks of true leadership. His formula for success is more maturity, not more data; stamina, not technique; and personal responsibility, not empathy.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>That quote makes it sound more black/white than the book really is&#x2013; and definitely more black/white than the way I apply what I learned from the book.  But it does give you an idea of the areas of emphasis in the book.  Anyway, I highly recommend it for psychotherapists, teachers, leaders and everyone who wants to be more aware of the impact of your behavior on others.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T15:54:35.804Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T15:54:36.075Z","PageId":87}}],"mentionCount":1},{"id":54,"title":"The Grand Jihad: How Islam and the Left Sabotage America","author":"Andew C McCarthy","amazonLink":"1594033773","amazonLinkImage":null,"createdAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.605Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.605Z","Mentions":[{"id":174,"mentionDate":"1485536880000","createdAt":"2017-05-06T18:13:10.140Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T18:13:10.140Z","BookId":54,"CommentId":36794,"Comment":{"id":36794,"commentUrl":"http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/01/26/open-thread-67-75/","commentId":"comment-458599","commentTimestamp":"1485536880000","commentAuthor":"Anonymous Bosch","commentHtml":"<blockquote><p>You know, I&#x2019;ve been a regular reader of National Review for a long time, and I cannot call to mind the former president being called any of those lovely things.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Can&#x2019;t be that regular if you missed <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/369605/no-executive-overreach-charles-c-w-cooke\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> by Charles CW Cooke, in which Obama is said to &#x201C;talk like an aspiring tyrant,&#x201D; or <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/254891/david-frums-wrong-direction-stanley-kurtz\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> by Stanley Kurtz calling him an &#x201C;orthodox Marxist-Leninist&#x201D; who has adopted &#x201C;a strategy of stealth&#x201D; learned from various sinister figures. </p>\n<p>Even if you&#x2019;ve only skimmed the titles, I don&#x2019;t see how you missed <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/302442/barack-obama-dictator-left-thomas-sowell\" rel=\"nofollow\">Barack Obama: Dictator of the Left</a> by Thomas Sowell. </p>\n<p>And of course no tour of the National Review authors&#x2019; hyperventilating would be complete without reference to <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1594033773/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Andy McCarthy</a>, where one doesn&#x2019;t have to go past the dust jacket to see that Obama&#x2019;s &#x201C;Islamist sympathies run deep.&#x201D;</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T15:53:14.866Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T15:53:15.450Z","PageId":67}}],"mentionCount":1},{"id":55,"title":"Mobbed!: What to Do When They Really Are Out to Get You","author":"Janice Harper Ph.D.","amazonLink":"0692693335","amazonLinkImage":null,"createdAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.605Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.605Z","Mentions":[{"id":191,"mentionDate":"1470208200000","createdAt":"2017-05-06T18:14:07.529Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T18:14:07.529Z","BookId":55,"CommentId":99435,"Comment":{"id":99435,"commentUrl":"http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/07/31/ot55-thready-for-hillary/","commentId":"comment-393257","commentTimestamp":"1470208200000","commentAuthor":"Cord Shirt","commentHtml":"<p>In case your goal is &#x201C;staying safe from mobbing,&#x201D; <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Mobbed-What-When-They-Really/dp/0692693335/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here&#x2019;s</a> a book on avoiding and/or coping with mobbing by an anthropologist who was mobbed.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T16:01:57.820Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T16:01:59.688Z","PageId":169}}],"mentionCount":1},{"id":56,"title":"Hold On to Your Kids: Why Parents Need to Matter More Than Peers","author":"Gordon Neufeld","amazonLink":"0375760288","amazonLinkImage":null,"createdAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.605Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.605Z","Mentions":[{"id":224,"mentionDate":"1465756200000","createdAt":"2017-05-06T18:18:16.412Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T18:18:16.412Z","BookId":56,"CommentId":119156,"Comment":{"id":119156,"commentUrl":"http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/06/12/open-thread-51-5/","commentId":"comment-371259","commentTimestamp":"1465756200000","commentAuthor":"<a href=\"http://wordriverdelta.com\" rel=\"external nofollow\" class=\"url\">Elimelech</a>","commentHtml":"<p>As the Dean of a tiny independent high school (64 students) I am wargaming the creation of a house system for 7th-12th grade.</p>\n<p>[status: fear and trembling because this could turn out to be a horrible idea.]</p>\n<p>Here are the quirky facts and restrictions on the system. The school only meets three days a week (the other two days are for homework, parent-guided learning, and extra-curricular activities). There cannot be new time commitments on the day for either teachers or students, meaning the system needs to be elegant enough that one man (myself) can run it and explain it to my fellow faculty.</p>\n<p>The purpose of the house system is to increase buy-in to the school&#x2019;s model, to promote academic self-discipline (not to be confused with grit) and accomplishment by awarding them some form of ESTEEM, to provide some sense of identity to these students who among other issues, don&#x2019;t even know how to describe their school to other kids (maybe that&#x2019;s beside the point).</p>\n<p>I think three houses should do the trick.</p>\n<p>What I have come up with so far is a big brother, big sister idea such that older kids are encouraged to encourage younger kids to excel in their studies. I am not exactly sure if this part is even a good idea, but I am thinking older students two grades or more above a younger student should choose a younger student to befriend (or at least be on cordial speaking terms with) so that lunch time can be slightly de-cliqued and being a nerd isn&#x2019;t a social stigma.</p>\n<p>My other idea is to wed the house system to school wide and class wide academic competitions that happen every year. In this way, point allocations within the system are determined in advance and don&#x2019;t seem biased and arbitrary. There are no new entities created by doing this and the points are based on real aivities that happen anyway.</p>\n<p>The reward structure is ESTEEM POINTS (framed in a way yet to be determined) from administration/faculty, which cascades down, I deeply hope, into tribe comraderie. At the end of the year, there will be a party for everyone in honor of the winning house.</p>\n<p>Bias alert: I have been reading a lot Gabor Mate and Neufeld, and especially his book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Hold-Your-Kids-Parents-Matter/dp/0375760288?ie=UTF8&amp;*Version*=1&amp;*entries*=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hold On To Your Kids</a>. There is a lot of relationship theory and attachment theory in these works, and its epistemic status is fairly unknown to me (I&#x2019;d be very interested if Scott had any opinions on this matter). But it rings true, and since it rings true, I can&#x2019;t help but be extremely partial to their emphatic claim that attachment to one&#x2019;s peers in youth is ultimately deleterious to maturation. This, again, may be corroborated by Scott&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/23/ssc-gives-a-graduation-speech/\">idyllic graduation speech</a>. All that to say, I am trying to create a system designed so that the students take their cues from those who are more emotionally and intellectually mature, and whatever else there is, than themselves. Kids don&#x2019;t need to fall into the trap of lusting for peer approval. It&#x2019;s just no good.</p>\n<p>Final historical note: Last year, I employed a Quirrel Points system in my 9th grade class (chose that group since they were larger and more energetic), designed to reward homework completion and academic accomplishment. The purpose was to get disaffected students to participate the classroom. There was a 70% increase in participation and on average 94% of the kids completed their homework assignments. Obviously, that&#x2019;s still not that good. But we&#x2019;re getting somewhere. The issue with the Quirrel system is I can&#x2019;t foresee it working with 11th graders. They will recognize it as a gimmick, lame, or adults-trying-too-hard.</p>\n<p>The absolute key for all these things is to avoid being gimmicky and to wed points to a real foundation, such that students can gain a sense of personal accomplishment and contribution.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T16:04:59.274Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T16:04:59.883Z","PageId":196}}],"mentionCount":1},{"id":57,"title":"A Billionaire Dinosaur Forced Me Gay- Part Two: Dinosaur Erotica","author":"Hunter Fox","amazonLink":"B00QU8KCNG","amazonLinkImage":null,"createdAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.605Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.605Z","Mentions":[{"id":283,"mentionDate":"1436082720000","createdAt":"2017-05-06T18:35:12.770Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T18:35:12.770Z","BookId":57,"CommentId":228488,"Comment":{"id":228488,"commentUrl":"http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/07/04/ot23-thread-white-and-blue/","commentId":"comment-216922","commentTimestamp":"1436082720000","commentAuthor":"zz","commentHtml":"<p>A friend of a friend reviewed the <a href=\"http://aarongertler.net/thesis/\" rel=\"nofollow\">literature on effective fundraising techniques</a> for his senior thesis.

I&#x2019;m going to try to answer some of your questions:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Furthermore every single hypothesis I have seen advanced by feminists to explain the STEM sex gap (and in truth virtually every sex gap) seems to paint a picture of women that is &#x2026; that women are weak, timid, easily influenced, do not know their own minds and can not be trusted to make their own decisions.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I think you&#x2019;re reading something into these arguments that isn&#x2019;t there &#x2014; that the theories implicit in the arguments are only supposed to apply to women.  I believe that the perspective is actually that men and women are similarly weak, timid, easily influenced, etc. but that due to prevailing cultural attitudes, men are &#x201C;easily influenced&#x201D; into more active, heroic roles and women are &#x201C;easily influenced&#x201D; into passive, support-type roles.  The problem may be that you don&#x2019;t realize that, to most of the people making these arguments, culture is supposed to be a much stronger force in shaping one&#x2019;s preferences than anything intrinsic to the individual.</p>\n<p>That is, the &#x201C;feminist&#x201D; theory here is that women have different outcomes (including different preferences) because they are socialized differently than men are.  On this theory, women must be protected from memetic harm.  Men don&#x2019;t need this protection not because they are stronger than or less easily influenced than women, but because their socialization is presumed by the feminist not to be harmful.</p>\n<p>Note, I am not making any judgment here about whether any parts of the implicit theory are true or not.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Whats more is that this seems to be a trend. Whether its the &#x201C;anti-manspreading&#x201D; campaign, the &#x201C;anti-street harassment&#x201D; campaign, the campaign to &#x201C;nudge&#x201D; women into STEM subjects, the refusal to consider women&#x2019;s aggregate choices in employment as it pertains to the &#x201C;wage gap&#x201D;, or the unequal treatment of males and females regarding alcohol and its effect on sexual consent, the underlying message seems to be that women are fragile, weak willed, victims who can not be trusted to make their own decisions or bear responsibility for their own choices.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Assuming you meant, &#x201C;anti-mansplaining&#x201D;.  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Men-Explain-Things-Rebecca-Solnit/dp/1608463869\" rel=\"nofollow\">This</a> book was written before the author had heard of the term &#x201C;mansplaining&#x201D; (and in a forward written for a later edition the author mentions not thinking the term especially helpful).  Anecdotally (and since you feel free to draw on experience to support most of your claims, I feel fine doing the same) it really does seem as though there&#x2019;s a tendency for at least some men to underestimate the intellectual abilities and accomplishments of women.  <em>To the extent that this is a real phenomenon, it seems valid to me to raise awareness of it and to try to discourage it.</em>  Without a valid argument as to why I shouldn&#x2019;t believe &#x201C;mansplaining&#x201D; is a real phenomenon <em>or</em> why it would be desirable for women&#x2019;s intellect to be underestimated, I&#x2019;m stuck with the impression that this is actually a legitimate feminist complaint.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;anti-street harassment&#x201D; &#x2014; A lot of women have an open stated preference that fewer men catcall, flirt with, or generally express opinions on their appearance in public.  (I&#x2019;ll appeal to your obvious concern with women&#x2019;s preferences to make sense of why this is significant.)  Again anecdotally, it seems safe to me to say that most of the men engaged in this behavior don&#x2019;t do so as a result of unassailable motives.  Applying social pressure (mostly shame since that&#x2019;s the main vector for social pressure) to try to achieve one&#x2019;s open stated preferences seems legitimate to me.  It&#x2019;s the same way we keep people from cutting in line or from taking all the donuts from the break room.  If there was a legitimate argument that the sorts of behaviors being discouraged are actually useful to society in some important way I&#x2019;d love to hear it. </p>\n<p>the campaign to &#x201C;nudge&#x201D; women into STEM subjects &#x2013; Again, I don&#x2019;t think this is done with the intention of denying women their preferences.  I think it&#x2019;s done from the perspective that those preferences are primarily the result of socialization and that different sorts of socialization would give different preferences.  Feminists perceive our culture as steering young women away from <em>interest</em> in STEM  subjects and want our culture not to do that any more.  Feminists aren&#x2019;t saying young women <em>must</em> study STEM subjects.  They&#x2019;re saying they should be able to if they want to and they shouldn&#x2019;t have to contend with anti-woman bias in addition to the challenge of STEM material itself if they so choose.</p>\n<p>Feminists may be factually mistaken as to whether this is actually a good description of the state of affairs, but whether they&#x2019;re factually wrong says pretty much nothing about their motives which I think are much different than you believe them to be.  Since the feminist approach relies on assumptions that need to be empirically validated (and probably won&#x2019;t be) I won&#x2019;t argue as I did with your first two examples that this is a legitimate practice; still, I believe it&#x2019;s helpful to try to understand the perspective of the person against whose position you are arguing.</p>\n<p>refusal to to consider women&#x2019;s aggregate choices &#x2014; this is in some sense simpler than the other cases and in some sense more complex.  The more complex way of looking at this is that, as above, those choices and preferences are (under a feminist&#x2019;s way of seeing the world) at least in part the result of a process of socialization &#x2014; if the woman had been raised differently she would have different choices and preferences.  Feminists want to create a cultural environment in which women&#x2019;s preferences aren&#x2019;t constrained in the ways feminists currently perceive them to be.  (Again, they may be factually mistaken but that won&#x2019;t tell us much about their motives.)  So it&#x2019;s not that they&#x2019;re ignoring the content of women&#x2019;s preferences, it&#x2019;s that the content of those preferences is itself the issue under discussion from the perspective of a feminist.</p>\n<p>The simpler way to see this one is an instance of &#x201C;all arguments are soldiers.&#x201D;  If feminists admit that the pay gap is the result of preferences (actually, they usually do admit this and then argue that the preferences themselves are a result of a sexist culture), then they have lost what looks like a pretty good argument for affirmative action for women.</p>\n<p>the unequal treatment of males and females regarding alcohol and its effect on sexual consent &#x2013; Most feminists I&#x2019;ve seen writing on this topic will say that the rules are the same in both cases &#x2014; whether it&#x2019;s a woman or a man who is intoxicated, the result is still rape.  (I suspect there are plenty of feminists who think that men cannot be raped by definitional fiat.  Let&#x2019;s ignore the complete idiots on both sides.)  I think most feminists would argue that where such an inequality is perceived, that inequality actually results from unequal sexual aggression between men and women &#x2014; men may be more likely to proceed in cases that are ethically ambiguous. </p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s only the last couple paragraphs of your comment I take any issue with, and even then it&#x2019;s <em>mostly</em> just the fact that you seem to want to make a moral case against your opponents by (accidentally, it seems) misrepresenting their motives.  Try to avoid this &#x2014; it makes the argument you started out with look weaker than it really is.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T16:24:55.410Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T16:24:56.231Z","PageId":419}}],"mentionCount":1},{"id":5,"title":"Jesus and the Eyewitnesses","author":"Richard Bauckham","amazonLink":"0802863906","amazonLinkImage":null,"createdAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.592Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.592Z","Mentions":[{"id":79,"mentionDate":"1463600940000","createdAt":"2017-05-06T18:08:48.926Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T18:08:48.926Z","BookId":5,"CommentId":129745,"Comment":{"id":129745,"commentUrl":"http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/05/18/open-thread-49-75/","commentId":"comment-360059","commentTimestamp":"1463600940000","commentAuthor":"<a href=\"http://jaskology.com\" rel=\"external nofollow\" class=\"url\">Jaskologist</a>","commentHtml":"<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Jesus-Eyewitnesses-Gospels-Eyewitness-Testimony/dp/0802863906\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jesus and the Eyewitnesses</a> is large and thorough, but quite readable if you&#x2019;re into that sort of thing.</p>\n<p>A few chapters of it are summarized nicely in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5Ylt1pBMm8\" rel=\"nofollow\">this engaging talk</a>. tldr; They analyze the Gospels and Acts statistically by comparing the frequency of names with the actual frequency of names for the area and time span they describe.</p>\n<p>Don&#x2019;t bother with Carrier; mythicists are considered cranks for a reason.

If I find a concrete set of principles, that I think broadly applicable to all historical religions, I will say so in this thread and grant you victory.<br>\nNow to the principle <i>I think</i> underlies successful societies, and that I bet I won&#x2019;t find anywhere in Evola: effectiveness in delivering a sense of order, predictability and safety to subjects.<br>\nI enumerated this in a terribly long comment below this theory, and I recommend the first part of David Kilcullen&#x2019;s book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Out-Mountains-Coming-Urban-Guerrilla/dp/0199737509\" rel=\"nofollow\">Out of the Mountains</a> for reading, and it&#x2019;s fairly snappy and easy to get. I&#x2019;ll summarize:<br>\nA group of people that can establish a predictable, normative system of rewards and sanctions, and enforce them with measures administrative, persuasive, and coercive, over a stretch of area, and can defeat any challenges to its system is effectively a state, whether other states recognize it or not. The Jamaican &#x201C;garrison districts,&#x201D; and the Taliban court system, are fascinating examples of this.<br>\nWhat determines a state&#x2019;s viability is not some impossible-to-measure Center, but whether most ordinary subjects feel that they can achieve their own interests and be safe in the system. The Tunisians utterly failed this by ignoring entrepreneurs to benefit their capitalist and government class. Shutting those entrepreneurs out of the formal economy and leaving them to develop their own informal economy (including informal clerks where people can register market space and contracts in writing outside of the corrupt state-generated system) they left them in a market environment that they felt was neither ordered nor predictable.<br>\nCome to think of it, this sounds like that great organizing principle that the Traditionalist School is searching for. It&#x2019;s called <i>enlightened self-interest.</i><br>\nA state that makes a large majority of people feel like they have a stake in its continued existence will continue to exist. The  Taliban, as I enumerated in the Long Comment below, do this by mediating disputes, and doing so in writing. From &#x201C;Out of the Mountains:&#x201D;<br>\n&#x201C;When the Taliban court has reached a verdict, both parties in the dispute are obliged to sign, or make their mark, on a court document held by the local underground cell. This record allows enforceability, but it also puts those who sign at the mercy of the Taliban. By recognizing the Taliban court&#x2019;s authority to resolve disputes, our hypothetical elder has signed onto their broader agenda.&#x201D;<br>\nIf I go to the LA County courthouse to mediate a dispute against my neighbor, I am giving the County, and the State and Federal governments that create it, legitimacy and sign onto their agenda &#x2013; which is to continue to exist and govern the United States, of which my home is a part. If I thought the local courts would not deliver a fair verdict, or I was unable to access the administrative resources of the courthouse, I would have much less incentive to support the County or its parent governments. And I&#x2019;d be much more willing to support a revolutionary group that comes along, promising security, predictability, and order. There&#x2019;s a reason the Taliban took over so much of Afghanistan after the end of the Soviet invasion &#x2013; they did <i>exactly this</i> in an environment that was overrun with rapacious warlords shooting at each other, and ordinary people wanted some security and order, even if it meant agreeing to the Taliban&#x2019;s rather harsh methods of rule. This is how Mao expanded Communist control over so much of China &#x2013; enforcing order, predictability, and security in an environment overrun with warlords who weren&#x2019;t much liked by the people.<br>\nA revolution is a competition for control.

First, the mainstream should be told that gays are victims of fate, in the sense that most never had a choice to accept or reject their sexual preference. The message must read: &#x201C;As far as gays can tell, they were born gay, just as you were born heterosexual or white or black or bright or athletic. Nobody ever tricked or seduced them; they never made a choice, and are not morally blameworthy. What they do isn&#x2019;t willfully contrary &#x2013; it&#x2019;s only natural for them. This twist of fate could as easily have happened to you!&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Format A for Familiarization: The Testimonial.</p>\n<p>To make gays seem less mysterious, present a series of short spots featuring the boy-or girl-next-door, fresh and appealing, or warm and lovable grandma grandpa types. Seated in homey surroundings, they respond to an off camera interviewer with assurance, good nature, and charm. Their comments bring out three social facts:</p>\n<p>1. There is someone special in their life, a long-term relationship (to stress gay stability, monogamy, commitment);</p>\n<p>2. Their families are very important to them, and are supportive of them (to stress that gays are not &#x201C;anti-family,&#x201D; and that families need not be anti-gay.)</p>\n<p>3. As far as they can remember they have always been gay, and were probably born gay; they certainly never decided on a preference one way or the other (stressing that gays are doing what is natural for them, and are not being willfully contrary). The subjects should be interviewed alone, not with their lovers or children, for to include others in the picture would unwisely raise disturbing questions about the complexities of gay social relations, which these commercials could not explain. It is best instead to take one thing at a time.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I thought this was only anti-gay propaganda and never really suggested by gay rights groups or representatives, but no, it was a suggested campaign to gain sympathy and &#x2018;normalise&#x2019; LGBT as much as possible to overcome resistance from the majority.</p>\n<p>Kirk went on to write a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/After-Ball-America-Conquer-Hatred/dp/0452264987\" rel=\"nofollow\">book</a> with Hunter Madsen called &#x201C;After the Ball: How America Will Conquer Its Fear and Hatred of Gays in the 90s&#x201D;.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T15:59:08.623Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T15:59:09.064Z","PageId":139}}],"mentionCount":1},{"id":353,"title":"Anger and Forgiveness: Resentment, Generosity, Justice","author":"Martha C.

There&#x2019;s an associated reader, too &#x2013; but it&#x2019;s not necessary (a decent bible plus the internet ought to provide most of it) &#x2013; and I recall some of the footnotes in the edition I had being missing.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Testament-Anchor-Reference-Library/dp/0300140169/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1463664559&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=raymond+brown\" rel=\"nofollow\">Raymond Brown&#x2019;s introduction</a> I remember as being good too, but I spent less time with it than with Ehrman. As I recall, Brown was really big on John &#x2013; John usually gets less attention than the synoptics. </p>\n<p>Also, Ehrman is an evangelical Protestant turned agnostic, whereas Brown was a Catholic. So they&#x2019;re going to have somewhat different approaches. </p>\n<p>A good bible is a must. NRSV is pretty standard for scholarship these days. One really cool thing I have is the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Jewish-Annotated-New-Testament/dp/0195297709\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jewish Annotated New Testament</a>, which is a footnoted NRSV New Testament with essays and such by Jewish scholars. Really helps put things in context. </p>\n<p>If you don&#x2019;t have any Greek, and even if you do, a gospel synopsis is helpful  in letting you compare the four gospels, and compare the Greek to the English. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Synopsis-Four-Gospels-Quattuor-Evangeliorum/dp/3438054051\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Aland one</a> is kind of the gold standard. I actually preferred <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Parallel-Gospels-Synopsis-Christian-Writing/dp/0199739412/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1463665099&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=zeba+crook\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Zeba Crook one</a> which is a literal word-for-word translation with a glossary. It is better for letting you compare the Greek to the English and see where translations flatten things out and so forth. If you really want to get hardcore, a Greek lexicon can help &#x2013; I remember liking <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Analytical-Lexicon-Greek-New-Testament/dp/0310542103/ref=sr_1_14?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1463665450&amp;sr=1-14&amp;keywords=mounce\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mounce&#x2019;s analytical lexicon</a> but then again I was taking Greek, so it might be a bit much. </p>\n<p>Finally, if you&#x2019;re doing historical-critical studies, the parables probably interest you. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Stories-Intent-Comprehensive-Guide-Parables/dp/0802842410/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1463665816&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=klyne+snodgrass\" rel=\"nofollow\">This</a> was one of the texts for a course I took on the parables, and I remember it being really good. It gives a good overview of religious and scholarly interpretation of the parables.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T16:06:40.544Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T16:06:41.518Z","PageId":209}}],"mentionCount":1},{"id":215,"title":"Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art","author":"Scott McCloud","amazonLink":"006097625X","amazonLinkImage":null,"createdAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.629Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.629Z","Mentions":[{"id":118,"mentionDate":"1459358040000","createdAt":"2017-05-06T18:10:07.480Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T18:10:07.480Z","BookId":215,"CommentId":148337,"Comment":{"id":148337,"commentUrl":"http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/03/28/ot46-open-rebellion/","commentId":"comment-341321","commentTimestamp":"1459358040000","commentAuthor":"<a href=\"http://www.nancybuttons.com\" rel=\"external nofollow\" class=\"url\">Nancy Lebovitz</a>","commentHtml":"<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Comics-The-Invisible-Art/dp/006097625X\" rel=\"nofollow\">Understanding Comics</a> is an analysis of what comics are, why people like them, and how sequential story-telling works.

There&#x2019;s an associated reader, too &#x2013; but it&#x2019;s not necessary (a decent bible plus the internet ought to provide most of it) &#x2013; and I recall some of the footnotes in the edition I had being missing.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Testament-Anchor-Reference-Library/dp/0300140169/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1463664559&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=raymond+brown\" rel=\"nofollow\">Raymond Brown&#x2019;s introduction</a> I remember as being good too, but I spent less time with it than with Ehrman. As I recall, Brown was really big on John &#x2013; John usually gets less attention than the synoptics. </p>\n<p>Also, Ehrman is an evangelical Protestant turned agnostic, whereas Brown was a Catholic. So they&#x2019;re going to have somewhat different approaches. </p>\n<p>A good bible is a must. NRSV is pretty standard for scholarship these days. One really cool thing I have is the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Jewish-Annotated-New-Testament/dp/0195297709\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jewish Annotated New Testament</a>, which is a footnoted NRSV New Testament with essays and such by Jewish scholars. Really helps put things in context. </p>\n<p>If you don&#x2019;t have any Greek, and even if you do, a gospel synopsis is helpful  in letting you compare the four gospels, and compare the Greek to the English. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Synopsis-Four-Gospels-Quattuor-Evangeliorum/dp/3438054051\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Aland one</a> is kind of the gold standard. I actually preferred <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Parallel-Gospels-Synopsis-Christian-Writing/dp/0199739412/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1463665099&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=zeba+crook\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Zeba Crook one</a> which is a literal word-for-word translation with a glossary. It is better for letting you compare the Greek to the English and see where translations flatten things out and so forth. If you really want to get hardcore, a Greek lexicon can help &#x2013; I remember liking <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Analytical-Lexicon-Greek-New-Testament/dp/0310542103/ref=sr_1_14?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1463665450&amp;sr=1-14&amp;keywords=mounce\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mounce&#x2019;s analytical lexicon</a> but then again I was taking Greek, so it might be a bit much. </p>\n<p>Finally, if you&#x2019;re doing historical-critical studies, the parables probably interest you. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Stories-Intent-Comprehensive-Guide-Parables/dp/0802842410/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1463665816&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=klyne+snodgrass\" rel=\"nofollow\">This</a> was one of the texts for a course I took on the parables, and I remember it being really good. It gives a good overview of religious and scholarly interpretation of the parables.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T16:06:40.544Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T16:06:41.518Z","PageId":209}}],"mentionCount":1},{"id":269,"title":"The Anubis Gates","author":"Tim Powers","amazonLink":"0441004016","amazonLinkImage":null,"createdAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.633Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.633Z","Mentions":[{"id":275,"mentionDate":"1450963020000","createdAt":"2017-05-06T18:32:32.873Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T18:32:32.873Z","BookId":269,"CommentId":178860,"Comment":{"id":178860,"commentUrl":"http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/12/19/ot38-threader-than-today/","commentId":"comment-290150","commentTimestamp":"1450963020000","commentAuthor":"<a href=\"http://jaskology.com\" rel=\"external nofollow\" class=\"url\">Jaskologist</a>","commentHtml":"<p>Read Tim Powers&#x2019; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Anubis-Gates-Science-Fiction/dp/0441004016\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Anubis Gates</a>.

You have a belief system.  You believe it without evidence and/or you make up the evidence as you go along, in the way that you interpret events in your (or your patient&#x2019;s) life within the framework of your belief system.  And you are clueless as to how subjective this all is.</p>\n<p>Belief systems seem rational to people.  But really they are just big security blankets, or life preservers, to satisfy one&#x2019;s needs for emotional security, and for certainty.  Through them, you know exactly the right or virtuous action to take in any situation.  You know exactly how to be an expert in your profession, even if you just read your very first book about it.  </p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s an accident of history that the highest status psychotherapists are psychiatrists, in the current system.  Although there are exceptions to the rule, the average psychologist or social worker usually knows more about how to do psychotherapy than the average psychiatrist does, for a number of reasons. These reasons include not suffering much from sleep deprivation during training, as psychiatrists do; not having most of their training be about medicine rather than psychology; and being more grounded and sensitive, on average, due to having lower status and less power.   </p>\n<p>There are some advantages that psychiatrists do have though, such as knowing how to prescribe medications when needed, and being able to recognize it more easily when the supposed mental disorder is actually a physical disorder.         </p>\n<p>Belief systems must be very necessary for humans, because they are everywhere, and some of them even successfully charge super high prices for entry.  </p>\n<p>There is the rationalist belief system.  Rationalists really think they are being logical and rational while they nit pick, cherry pick, lemon pick etc.</p>\n<p>There is the Right Wing ideological system so common on this board when politics comes up.  To me this looks and feels exactly like a Right Wing Safe Space and echo chamber bubble.  But to most participants on this board, who are Right Wing themselves, I am sure that the board appears to be rational and objective.  </p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s hard to see a belief system objectively, when you are inside of it.</p>\n<p>One giant overarching belief seems to be a belief in black/white thinking.  And there is lots of that in our culture.  E.g. if you think the job of psychotherapist has to never require an M.D. or always require one.  If you have to always talk at the object level or always at the meta level.  Or if you have to always piss off your patients, or always be nice to them.  If you have to only  be open to a patient and connect with them as a human vs. if you have to always be practically a robot in your dispensation of medication or advice or response to patient&#x2019;s words with particular techniques.    </p>\n<p>Some therapists, and patients, seem to be caught within such black/white frameworks.  But psychotherapy is actually as large as human life, human needs, and the meanings humans give to their lives, and the traumas and other experiences that humans have and their effects.  That&#x2019;s why so many therapists run screaming and then look to find their certainty in rigid belief systems.  </p>\n<p>And the great variety of things that different patients need mean that it can be difficult for a patient to find a good match in a therapist.  If the therapist is all empathy, and you need direction or challenge&#x2014;or vice versa&#x2014;then you need to find someone who is a better match.  </p>\n<p>Sometimes you can do this by phone by asking what kinds of interventions the therapist does to help their patients.  And of course, some therapists can both challenge a patient and give empathy, as needed.  But there is an interpersonal chemistry involved, where some therapist/patient duos are great matches, and others do not work at all.  </p>\n<p>The same for therapy groups and support groups.  AA is some people&#x2019;s wonderful solution, and other people&#x2019;s pointless exercise in futility, depending on their needs and also on the other personalities present in the group.  Interestingly, some of the best AA groups contain people who have been through a lot of psychotherapy themselves.     </p>\n<p>One psychology professor I once had, asked me &#x201C;How can you be aware of what&#x2019;s not there?&#x201D;  When he asked me, I didn&#x2019;t know the answer, nor did he.  But now I think I know.  You are aware of what&#x2019;s not there, from experience&#x2013; your own, your patients&#x2019; experiences, the experiences of the people around you.  You can tell what is missing when things aren&#x2019;t going well for a patient, by observing what is present when things ARE working well for people in their lives.    </p>\n<p>Cognitive distortions come into play in schools of psychotherapy, as in much of life.  There are interesting books written about cognitive distortions, like </p>\n<p>You Are Not So Smart: Why You Have Too Many Friends on Facebook, Why Your Memory Is Mostly Fiction, an d 46 Other Ways You&#x2019;re Deluding Yourself Paperback &#x2013; November 6, 2012<br>\nby David McRaney</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/You-Are-Not-So-Smart/dp/1592407366/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483029059&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=you+are+now+less+dumb\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.amazon.com/You-Are-Not-So-Smart/dp/1592407366/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483029059&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=you+are+now+less+dumb</a></p>\n<p>You are Now Less Dumb: How to Conquer Mob Mentality, How to Buy Happiness, and All the Other Ways to Outsmart Yourself Paperback &#x2013; August 5, 2014<br>\nby David McRaney </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/You-are-Now-Less-Dumb/dp/1592408796/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483029059&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=you+are+now+less+dumb\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.amazon.com/You-are-Now-Less-Dumb/dp/1592408796/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483029059&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=you+are+now+less+dumb</a></p>\n<p>One of the distortions covered in this latter book here is deindividuation, through which, despite our best intentions, we pretty much disappear when subsumed by a mob mentality.</p>\n<p>People think of mobs as big angry crowds outdoors.  But the group of people in one&#x2019;s professional training program can be a sort of mob&#x2013; and indeed is more powerful, for a longer time, over the individual than your typical mob.  You can&#x2019;t just walk away and go back home in an hour&#x2013; not if you really want the degree or the professional license you are pursuing.</p>\n<p>Many schools of psychology are religion and are also power politics&#x2013; due to the power that supervisors have over trainees, and the power that trainees and other therapists have over vulnerable and sick patients.  To use power appropriately and for good, rather than for evil, or rather than for getting hopelessly lost with your power  and not having any idea what the impact of your own behavior is, is a challenge that few humans seem to be capable of dealing with well. </p>\n<p>Not going along with the prevailing belief system can put one in a really bad position.  So many people just chime in and go along to get along&#x2013; patients, psychotherapist trainees, people whose families or friends or colleagues or favorite Internet board all lean the same way politically etc. </p>\n<p>My favorite book that I have read in a long time proposes an overall framework for therapists, parents, teachers, spouses, leaders of all kinds etc., in their work.  I am seldom impressed by a book, but this one has some good points.  The writer uses Bowen&#x2019;s family systems therapy as the basis for his theories, explained here below in wikipedia.  Although I do not believe every word of Bowen&#x2019;s theory, I find much of it useful. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bowen\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bowen</a>    </p>\n<p>The book I mentioned above, that is based on Bowen&#x2019;s theory, is A Failure of Nerve: Leadership in the Age of the Quick Fix Paperback &#x2013; February 1, 2007 by Edwin H. Friedman.  The author is dead, but somehow a new edition of the book is coming out in May of this year, so there must be people thinking it is still relevant, and apparently editors adding something to it.  I don&#x2019;t agree with everything in the book, but do with a lot of it.  Even where I disagree, it stimulates my thinking.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Failure-Nerve-Leadership-Age-Quick/dp/159627042X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483030635&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=A+Failure+of+Nerve\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.amazon.com/Failure-Nerve-Leadership-Age-Quick/dp/159627042X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483030635&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=A+Failure+of+Nerve</a></p>\n<p>From the summary on Amazaon: &#x201C;he argues for strength and self-differentiation as the marks of true leadership. His formula for success is more maturity, not more data; stamina, not technique; and personal responsibility, not empathy.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>That quote makes it sound more black/white than the book really is&#x2013; and definitely more black/white than the way I apply what I learned from the book.  But it does give you an idea of the areas of emphasis in the book.  Anyway, I highly recommend it for psychotherapists, teachers, leaders and everyone who wants to be more aware of the impact of your behavior on others.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T15:54:35.804Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T15:54:36.075Z","PageId":87}}],"mentionCount":1},{"id":316,"title":"Somatics: Reawakening The Mind's Control Of Movement, Flexibility, And Health","author":"Thomas Hanna","amazonLink":"0738209570","amazonLinkImage":null,"createdAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.642Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.642Z","Mentions":[{"id":258,"mentionDate":"1429036020000","createdAt":"2017-05-06T18:28:26.378Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T18:28:26.378Z","BookId":316,"CommentId":246062,"Comment":{"id":246062,"commentUrl":"http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/04/13/ot18-istanbul-not-constantinopen/","commentId":"comment-197519","commentTimestamp":"1429036020000","commentAuthor":"<a href=\"http://www.nancybuttons.com\" rel=\"external nofollow\" class=\"url\">Nancy Lebovitz</a>","commentHtml":"<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Somatics-Reawakening-Control-Movement-Flexibility/dp/0738209570\" rel=\"nofollow\">Somatics</a> has a good routine.

The precise location and source of each error was identified accurately, rehearsed, and corrected.<br>\n7. Tempo of individual performance trials was varied systematically; logically understandable changes in tempo occurred between trials (e.g. slowed things down to get tricky sections correct).<br>\n8. Target passages were repeated until the error was corrected and the passage was stabilized, as evidenced by the error&#x2019;s absence in subsequent trials.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The article claims that the top three pianists used all these strategies and all the lesser pianists barely utilized them. I find this both surprising, because every single student-musician who was serious about music uses them, and not surprising, because everyone I know who&#x2019;s serious uses these strategies; if you&#x2019;re not using them, no wonder you&#x2019;re not in the top.</p>\n<p>Then again, I live in an unusually good musical community. My friend is son of a professional conductor, has played Yo-Yo Ma&#x2019;s cello several times, and has studied under the best teachers in the world the country&#x2019;s best music programs. I have a fraction of his talent, growing-up-in-a-musical-household, and practice regimen, and I&#x2019;ve still been able to work with members of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_%28orchestras%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Philadelphia Orchestra</a>.</p>\n<p>Notice how close Texas (where the study in question was conducted) is to any of the Big Five orchestras. It&#x2019;s <i>extremely</i> plausible that the study subjects&#x2014;advanced undergraduate and graduate piano and piano pedagogy majors&#x2014;are genuinely unaware of the best practice strategies that are completely obvious to someone relatively talentless like me because they don&#x2019;t come from a culture that supports it*.</p>\n<p>There&#x2019;s probably a pre-selection effect here: if you&#x2019;re a music student and know how to practice effectively, you probably aren&#x2019;t going to school in Texas, and if you&#x2019;re a good music teacher and keep up with what works the best and are good at changing your mind in response to new evidence and maybe even read some cog psy literature, you probably aren&#x2019;t teaching in Texas.</p>\n<p>&#x2014;-</p>\n<p>*If you doubt that different regional cultures can have such drastic effects, just look briefly at how entirely Korea dominates The Rest of the World in Starcraft 2. I can&#x2019;t dig up a really great primary reference, but Koreans are so much better than &#x201C;foreigners&#x201D; (as they&#x2019;re called) that there&#x2019;s essentially two leagues: one for Koreans and one for everyone else, so they aren&#x2019;t beaten by Koreans. It&#x2019;s a bit like men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s leagues in physical sports: the best non-Koreans can maybe compete with second-string Koreans, but it&#x2019;s truly remarkable/unheard of for a foreigner to beat an A-team Korean. For instance, <a href=\"http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/Hydra\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hydra</a>, a Korean progamer somewhere between A- and B-team, was <a href=\"http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/2015_WCS_Season_1/Premier\" rel=\"nofollow\">recently defeated</a> by a foreigner, after going something like 60-0 against foreigners.</p>\n<p>&#x2026;There&#x2019;s a point here, and it&#x2019;s that Koreans beat the snot out of non-Koreans and that the best explanation is Korean culture: they treat the best Starcraft players like Americans treat the best baseballers (in all honesty, they inspire more awe&#x2014;when was the last time a baseballer was <a href=\"http://www.teamliquid.net/staff/Waxangel/jinairplane.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">painted on an airplane</a>?), and they&#x2019;ve figured out how to practice Starcraft most effectively. Foreigners don&#x2019;t the same coaching quality, high-level practice partners, or practice regimen, and thus get the snot beat out of them.</p>\n<p>So, yes: if a game like Starcraft, which is inherently internet-centric, can have the best players in different regions doing different things because of cultural differences, then we shouldn&#x2019;t be surprised to see something similar in classical music, which doesn&#x2019;t mesh well with the internet.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T16:23:19.962Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T16:23:20.983Z","PageId":393}}],"mentionCount":1},{"id":341,"title":"The Cartoon Guide to Statistics","author":"Larry Gonick","amazonLink":"0062731025","amazonLinkImage":null,"createdAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.644Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.644Z","Mentions":[{"id":77,"mentionDate":"1465077540000","createdAt":"2017-05-06T18:08:44.527Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T18:08:44.527Z","BookId":341,"CommentId":123647,"Comment":{"id":123647,"commentUrl":"http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/06/01/open-thread-50-75/","commentId":"comment-368414","commentTimestamp":"1465077540000","commentAuthor":"Douglas Knight","commentHtml":"<p>Not online.

And a lot of people are not attracted to a lot of other people.  What difference does it make, why?  Just move on and keep looking for your type.

They&#x2019;re called fat pigs and all kinds of other names.  Look at what Donald Trump has said about women he didn&#x2019;t like&#x2013; and they were not even hitting on him.

There are tons of misunderstandings on this board.  But sexual/romantic interest situations are worse than most, because people want so much to be attractive to people who are attractive to them.  </p>\n<p>Also there is this shame factor that seems to originate in more than one place&#x2013; traditional religious attitudes toward sex for one origin.  Another origin is both traditional and current rank and status hierarchies among humans. </p>\n<p>There are wealth, career, attractiveness, small group, and social status hierarchies that people pay attention to.

It&#x2019;s fascinating stuff. </p>\n<p>Two Irish brothers are convicted of murder but pardoned by the king, apparently because their sister is a lady of easy virtue who has been sleeping with some powerful men in a position to exert political pressure. The Wilkites respond with an appeal of murder&#x2013;a private criminal case. As Blackstone explains (while telling the reader that the appeal of felony still exists in the law but nobody does it any more because it really isn&#x2019;t practical), if someone is convicted in an appeal of felony the king cannot pardon him because the king is not a party to the suit&#x2013;any more than the king could cancel a tort verdict awarding damages. They don&#x2019;t succeed&#x2013;Blackstone was correct. </p>\n<p>But the attempt gladdens my radical heart, fitting neatly with my old argument that one reason the English maintained a system of privately prosecuted criminal law for so long was that, after the lively events of the 17th century, they realized that if the crown controlled prosecution the king&#x2019;s friends could get away with  murder.</p>\n<p>Lots of other neat stuff. I think I posted here on the question of whether law enforcement agents should be subject to the same penalties, civil and criminal, as other people. The Wilkites thought they should. When there was a demonstration in favor of Wilkes outside the prison where he was being held and it ended up with troops shooting some people, the Wilkites, who were conveniently in control of London at the time, charged not only some of the soldiers but one of the JP&#x2019;s in charge with murder. They didn&#x2019;t get a conviction, in part because the defendant soldier most clearly guilty was granted bail and vanished, but the JP seems to have been seriously scared of the risk of being tried for murder by a London jury.</p>\n<p>And Wilkes and his friends did succeed in winning a case for large damages against the Secretary of State and some of his agents, in the process establishing the principle that a blank warrant was not valid in British law, from which we get our fourth amendment.</p>\n<p>For anyone else interested in this stuff, the piece is a chapter in <i>An Ungovernable People</i>.

Its a great mediative tradition that eventually leads to amazing states of unity and freedom. It basically leads to the same type of changes  in the brain that have been found in Buddhist monks and other long term meditators. Drastic shifts in the centers involved with happiness, compassion etc. You should check out the work of Dr. Jeffrey Martin. He has done extensive interviews with over 1000 people who claim to have reach some form of enlightenment. He drew his subjects from a wide variety of contemplative traditions. There where very clear patterns in what these people described. Clear patterns in what kind of states they described and the progression in these states and how achieving them changed their life and well being.

For every Grant there is a Lee (cavalier), for every Jackson a Sherman (one of the oldest Puritan families).</p></blockquote>\n<p>Deor&#x2019;s inclusion of Sherman in this list indicates that he fails to grasp that Fischer doesn&#x2019;t claim that it&#x2019;s the four groups&#x2019; genetic heritage that is at issue. Rather, Fischer&#x2019;s point is that it&#x2019;s the cultural heritages of these groups that matters for understanding American history. Sherman <i>was</i> of good Puritan stock. As a general, however, he was the consummate Borderer: ruthless and vicious towards enemies who still fight back, magnanimous and generous towards enemies who have surrendered. For the purpose of historical analysis, Sherman&#x2019;s genetic heritage is immaterial. For all intents and purposes, he was a Borderer.</p>\n<blockquote><p>If rural Indiana is now Republican country, that has nothing to do with the origin of its settlers.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This error is tied to the point above. It has nothing to do with <i>the genetic heritage</i> of its settlers; it has everything to do with what became <i>the dominant culture</i> of its settlers. While Quakers and Puritans were certainly the first to move there, the later Borderers established the state&#x2019;s dominant culture.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It was [Southerners&#x2019;] loss to anti-slavery forces in the 1860 election and then the war that turned them, for generations, against the Federal government.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This, as a broad generalization, is simply false. Mark David Ledbetter makes this point very clear in the first two volumes of his magnificent <b><i>America&#x2019;s Forgotten History</i></b> series: <b><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Americas-Forgotten-History-Part-Foundations-ebook/dp/B003GXEU90\" rel=\"nofollow\">Foundations</a></b> and <b><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Americas-Forgotten-History-Part-Rupture-ebook/dp/B003GXEU1S\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rupture</a></b>. Southerners had a deep general hostility towards federal government power from the very beginning. Even the one massively glaring and stupendously hypocritical exception to that hostility &#x2014; slavery &#x2014; didn&#x2019;t develop until the late 1830s at the earliest. And after the Civil War, Southerners kept their massively inconsistent and stupendously hypocritical streak: they generally opposed the use of federal power <i>except</i> when it supported and enabled Jim Crow laws. Thus, they lauded <i>Plessy v. Ferguson</i> and many of Wilson&#x2019;s racist policies.</p>\n<p>The lesson IMO is that reality is always more complicated than our explanations of it. That goes for history, but also for any other disciplines that purports to explain how the world works, including the physical sciences. If we don&#x2019;t simplify it to at least some degree, we usually can&#x2019;t explain it. The only question is whether the simplifying filter we use corresponds to what actually happened, and Fischer&#x2019;s certainly seems to IMO.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T16:07:45.107Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T16:07:46.605Z","PageId":219}}],"mentionCount":1},{"id":189,"title":"Socrates Meets Marx: The Father of Philosophy Cross-examines the Founder of Communism","author":"Peter Kreeft","amazonLink":"1587318350","amazonLinkImage":null,"createdAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.628Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.628Z","Mentions":[{"id":99,"mentionDate":"1410715620000","createdAt":"2017-05-06T18:09:25.216Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T18:09:25.216Z","BookId":189,"CommentId":290902,"Comment":{"id":290902,"commentUrl":"http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/13/book-review-singer-on-marx/","commentId":"comment-144967","commentTimestamp":"1410715620000","commentAuthor":"Joe","commentHtml":"<p>Peter Kreeft (philosophy professor at Boston College) has a pretty good series of books called Socrates Meets that critiques most of the big modern thinkers including Marx.

There&#x2019;s an associated reader, too &#x2013; but it&#x2019;s not necessary (a decent bible plus the internet ought to provide most of it) &#x2013; and I recall some of the footnotes in the edition I had being missing.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Testament-Anchor-Reference-Library/dp/0300140169/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1463664559&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=raymond+brown\" rel=\"nofollow\">Raymond Brown&#x2019;s introduction</a> I remember as being good too, but I spent less time with it than with Ehrman. As I recall, Brown was really big on John &#x2013; John usually gets less attention than the synoptics. </p>\n<p>Also, Ehrman is an evangelical Protestant turned agnostic, whereas Brown was a Catholic. So they&#x2019;re going to have somewhat different approaches. </p>\n<p>A good bible is a must. NRSV is pretty standard for scholarship these days. One really cool thing I have is the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Jewish-Annotated-New-Testament/dp/0195297709\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jewish Annotated New Testament</a>, which is a footnoted NRSV New Testament with essays and such by Jewish scholars. Really helps put things in context. </p>\n<p>If you don&#x2019;t have any Greek, and even if you do, a gospel synopsis is helpful  in letting you compare the four gospels, and compare the Greek to the English. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Synopsis-Four-Gospels-Quattuor-Evangeliorum/dp/3438054051\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Aland one</a> is kind of the gold standard. I actually preferred <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Parallel-Gospels-Synopsis-Christian-Writing/dp/0199739412/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1463665099&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=zeba+crook\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Zeba Crook one</a> which is a literal word-for-word translation with a glossary. It is better for letting you compare the Greek to the English and see where translations flatten things out and so forth.

You have a belief system.  You believe it without evidence and/or you make up the evidence as you go along, in the way that you interpret events in your (or your patient&#x2019;s) life within the framework of your belief system.  And you are clueless as to how subjective this all is.</p>\n<p>Belief systems seem rational to people.  But really they are just big security blankets, or life preservers, to satisfy one&#x2019;s needs for emotional security, and for certainty.  Through them, you know exactly the right or virtuous action to take in any situation.  You know exactly how to be an expert in your profession, even if you just read your very first book about it.  </p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s an accident of history that the highest status psychotherapists are psychiatrists, in the current system.  Although there are exceptions to the rule, the average psychologist or social worker usually knows more about how to do psychotherapy than the average psychiatrist does, for a number of reasons. These reasons include not suffering much from sleep deprivation during training, as psychiatrists do; not having most of their training be about medicine rather than psychology; and being more grounded and sensitive, on average, due to having lower status and less power.   </p>\n<p>There are some advantages that psychiatrists do have though, such as knowing how to prescribe medications when needed, and being able to recognize it more easily when the supposed mental disorder is actually a physical disorder.         </p>\n<p>Belief systems must be very necessary for humans, because they are everywhere, and some of them even successfully charge super high prices for entry.  </p>\n<p>There is the rationalist belief system.  Rationalists really think they are being logical and rational while they nit pick, cherry pick, lemon pick etc.</p>\n<p>There is the Right Wing ideological system so common on this board when politics comes up.  To me this looks and feels exactly like a Right Wing Safe Space and echo chamber bubble.  But to most participants on this board, who are Right Wing themselves, I am sure that the board appears to be rational and objective.  </p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s hard to see a belief system objectively, when you are inside of it.</p>\n<p>One giant overarching belief seems to be a belief in black/white thinking.  And there is lots of that in our culture.  E.g. if you think the job of psychotherapist has to never require an M.D. or always require one.  If you have to always talk at the object level or always at the meta level.  Or if you have to always piss off your patients, or always be nice to them.  If you have to only  be open to a patient and connect with them as a human vs. if you have to always be practically a robot in your dispensation of medication or advice or response to patient&#x2019;s words with particular techniques.    </p>\n<p>Some therapists, and patients, seem to be caught within such black/white frameworks.  But psychotherapy is actually as large as human life, human needs, and the meanings humans give to their lives, and the traumas and other experiences that humans have and their effects.  That&#x2019;s why so many therapists run screaming and then look to find their certainty in rigid belief systems.  </p>\n<p>And the great variety of things that different patients need mean that it can be difficult for a patient to find a good match in a therapist.  If the therapist is all empathy, and you need direction or challenge&#x2014;or vice versa&#x2014;then you need to find someone who is a better match.  </p>\n<p>Sometimes you can do this by phone by asking what kinds of interventions the therapist does to help their patients.  And of course, some therapists can both challenge a patient and give empathy, as needed.  But there is an interpersonal chemistry involved, where some therapist/patient duos are great matches, and others do not work at all.  </p>\n<p>The same for therapy groups and support groups.  AA is some people&#x2019;s wonderful solution, and other people&#x2019;s pointless exercise in futility, depending on their needs and also on the other personalities present in the group.  Interestingly, some of the best AA groups contain people who have been through a lot of psychotherapy themselves.     </p>\n<p>One psychology professor I once had, asked me &#x201C;How can you be aware of what&#x2019;s not there?&#x201D;  When he asked me, I didn&#x2019;t know the answer, nor did he.  But now I think I know.  You are aware of what&#x2019;s not there, from experience&#x2013; your own, your patients&#x2019; experiences, the experiences of the people around you.  You can tell what is missing when things aren&#x2019;t going well for a patient, by observing what is present when things ARE working well for people in their lives.    </p>\n<p>Cognitive distortions come into play in schools of psychotherapy, as in much of life.  There are interesting books written about cognitive distortions, like </p>\n<p>You Are Not So Smart: Why You Have Too Many Friends on Facebook, Why Your Memory Is Mostly Fiction, an d 46 Other Ways You&#x2019;re Deluding Yourself Paperback &#x2013; November 6, 2012<br>\nby David McRaney</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/You-Are-Not-So-Smart/dp/1592407366/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483029059&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=you+are+now+less+dumb\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.amazon.com/You-Are-Not-So-Smart/dp/1592407366/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483029059&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=you+are+now+less+dumb</a></p>\n<p>You are Now Less Dumb: How to Conquer Mob Mentality, How to Buy Happiness, and All the Other Ways to Outsmart Yourself Paperback &#x2013; August 5, 2014<br>\nby David McRaney </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/You-are-Now-Less-Dumb/dp/1592408796/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483029059&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=you+are+now+less+dumb\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.amazon.com/You-are-Now-Less-Dumb/dp/1592408796/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483029059&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=you+are+now+less+dumb</a></p>\n<p>One of the distortions covered in this latter book here is deindividuation, through which, despite our best intentions, we pretty much disappear when subsumed by a mob mentality.</p>\n<p>People think of mobs as big angry crowds outdoors.

To use power appropriately and for good, rather than for evil, or rather than for getting hopelessly lost with your power  and not having any idea what the impact of your own behavior is, is a challenge that few humans seem to be capable of dealing with well. </p>\n<p>Not going along with the prevailing belief system can put one in a really bad position.  So many people just chime in and go along to get along&#x2013; patients, psychotherapist trainees, people whose families or friends or colleagues or favorite Internet board all lean the same way politically etc. </p>\n<p>My favorite book that I have read in a long time proposes an overall framework for therapists, parents, teachers, spouses, leaders of all kinds etc., in their work.  I am seldom impressed by a book, but this one has some good points.  The writer uses Bowen&#x2019;s family systems therapy as the basis for his theories, explained here below in wikipedia.  Although I do not believe every word of Bowen&#x2019;s theory, I find much of it useful. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bowen\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bowen</a>    </p>\n<p>The book I mentioned above, that is based on Bowen&#x2019;s theory, is A Failure of Nerve: Leadership in the Age of the Quick Fix Paperback &#x2013; February 1, 2007 by Edwin H. Friedman.  The author is dead, but somehow a new edition of the book is coming out in May of this year, so there must be people thinking it is still relevant, and apparently editors adding something to it.  I don&#x2019;t agree with everything in the book, but do with a lot of it.  Even where I disagree, it stimulates my thinking.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Failure-Nerve-Leadership-Age-Quick/dp/159627042X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483030635&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=A+Failure+of+Nerve\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.amazon.com/Failure-Nerve-Leadership-Age-Quick/dp/159627042X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483030635&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=A+Failure+of+Nerve</a></p>\n<p>From the summary on Amazaon: &#x201C;he argues for strength and self-differentiation as the marks of true leadership. His formula for success is more maturity, not more data; stamina, not technique; and personal responsibility, not empathy.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>That quote makes it sound more black/white than the book really is&#x2013; and definitely more black/white than the way I apply what I learned from the book.  But it does give you an idea of the areas of emphasis in the book.  Anyway, I highly recommend it for psychotherapists, teachers, leaders and everyone who wants to be more aware of the impact of your behavior on others.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T15:54:35.804Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T15:54:36.075Z","PageId":87}}],"mentionCount":1},{"id":87,"title":"The Chronicles of Master Li and Number Ten Ox","author":"Barry Hughart","amazonLink":"B005ISOYLK","amazonLinkImage":null,"createdAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.608Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.608Z","Mentions":[{"id":317,"mentionDate":"1474427100000","createdAt":"2017-05-06T18:52:21.275Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T18:52:21.275Z","BookId":87,"CommentId":82724,"Comment":{"id":82724,"commentUrl":"http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/09/18/open-thread-58-5/","commentId":"comment-411710","commentTimestamp":"1474427100000","commentAuthor":"LHN","commentHtml":"<p>I had no idea the Hughart books were available as ebooks.

I think it&#x2019;s very bad if fear of cultural appropriation keeps people from learning from each other.</p>\n<p>Years ago someone asked me  whether I thought I was less able to learn tai chi because I wasn&#x2019;t Chinese. At the time, I said that I didn&#x2019;t see a problem because the human body is the human body.</p>\n<p>Since then, I&#x2019;ve found out that the Chinese word <i>sung</i> which is usually translated as relaxed is not well-translated that way. The usual distinction is that <i>sung</i> doesn&#x2019;t mean like an overcooked noodle, it means like a cat watching a mousehole. The fact that English doesn&#x2019;t have a word for the latter concept is probably a serious gap in our view of the world&#x2013; our model marks too much effort (and valorizes it) and too little effort, while leaving optimal effort out of the picture.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Secrets-Pelvis-Martial-Arts-Practical-ebook/dp/B00C14WO5W\" rel=\"nofollow\">Secrets of the Pelvis for the Martial Arts</a> has an appendix about the connotations of &#x201C;round&#x201D; in Chinese.

Ony clearly expresses a preference for smaller countries.  And I think Tibor has said the same. I don&#x2019;t think anyone has said that big countries are usually governed better. I would like to see some discussion on whether or not Ony and Tibor are correct.</p>\n<p>Intuitively I tend to agree that smaller countries are better. In my book &#x201C;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Simplify-Government-Mark-Anderson-ebook/dp/B01GLQACCW/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1469241098&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=simplify+government#navbar\" rel=\"nofollow\">Simplify Government</a>,&#x201D; I argue that more complex government leads to less efficient and effective outcomes. And I think that smaller countries are almost certain to have simpler governments than larger ones, so in that respect I think smaller countries would likely govern more effectively and be more accountable to its citizenry. The counter-point to this are the many complicated and dysfunctional state and local governments that exist now in the US. Would these governments run better if the Federal government wasn&#x2019;t a distraction to citizens?</p>\n<p>And I see strong reasons for favoring large countries.  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_European_Union\" rel=\"nofollow\">The EU began</a> as a way to avoid future European wars by uniting previous warring countries into one confederation (with some large country like features). And it has been extra-ordinarily successful at that &#x2013; I think it is unimaginable today that any of the EU countries today would declare war on another one, any more than Kentucky would declare war on Ohio. And I think part of the rationale of the EU was also to try to duplicate the economic advantages of the single market that exists in the US. And I think the EU has been successful there too, with borders becoming much less significant than they were. And despite all the Euro bashing that has occurred over the last ten years or so, it seems to me that a single currency has also been very effective in simplifying lives of people traveling between countries or doing business with each other. Admittedly I have little direct knowledge of the impact, having never even been to Euro-land. But from my distant perspective it appears to be a great thing to have a single currency and many unifying laws across the EU.</p>\n<p>And I do find it difficult to imagine life in the US if it was broken up into many smaller countries. I can now drive for thousands of miles across the country without encountering a single government official questioning why I am traveling or where I am going. I can move to anywhere else in the country and get a job and live there as easily as my own location. Of course I would have to follow their local laws and customs, which might be different from my current location, but still under the US constitution and laws.  There is a lot of freedom in having a large country available for travel and living and commerce without substantial borders between different locations.</p>\n<p>Does anyone know of empirical research on the advantages or disadvantages of large countries vs small ones? Like perhaps how do large vs small correlate with the rankings of countries in Freedom House or other types of rankings?</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T15:51:08.157Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T15:51:08.567Z","PageId":39}}],"mentionCount":1},{"id":113,"title":"Nevada","author":"Immogen Binnie","amazonLink":"B00C03P6Y0","amazonLinkImage":null,"createdAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.610Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.610Z","Mentions":[{"id":274,"mentionDate":"1411236900000","createdAt":"2017-05-06T18:32:02.272Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T18:32:02.272Z","BookId":113,"CommentId":290419,"Comment":{"id":290419,"commentUrl":"http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/15/ozy-a-response-to-spandrell/","commentId":"comment-146728","commentTimestamp":"1411236900000","commentAuthor":"veronica d","commentHtml":"<p>It is true that some AMAB people have strong, recurrent sexual fantasies about being a women. That is the fact in need of explanation.</p>\n<p>Autogynephilia is an etiological theory. It posits <i>why</i> this happens, and like many psychoanalytical theories, it insists on viewing libidinous desire as singularly causal, which is to say, they see this a primarily as a failure to sexualize normally. But why assume sexual development happens just this way? Why assume the causality works in this direction? Why assume &#x201C;erotic target location errors&#x201D; are actually a <i>thing</i> in the brain?</p>\n<p>What we have here is, in my view, a theory which tells us more about the sexual preoccupations of a few cisgendered, heteronormative doctors than about transgender people.</p>\n<p>There is an alternate theory of all of this, which explains the data and has proven more useful in gender therapy. It goes something like this:</p>\n<p>1. Some people are born with a mismatch between their gender identity and their physical sex. This mismatch exists to various degrees and with different qualities. (Brains are weird.)</p>\n<p>2. For some men with this condition, their cross-gender identity is suppressed, largely due to social factors such as enforced masculinity.</p>\n<p>3. The tools of enforced masculinity are violence, fear, and shame.</p>\n<p>4. Thus these men live in denial and heavily rationalize away their gender issues.</p>\n<p>5. However, because of testosterone, these men experience strong libidos.</p>\n<p>6. This creates a crisis.

There&#x2019;s an associated reader, too &#x2013; but it&#x2019;s not necessary (a decent bible plus the internet ought to provide most of it) &#x2013; and I recall some of the footnotes in the edition I had being missing.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Testament-Anchor-Reference-Library/dp/0300140169/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1463664559&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=raymond+brown\" rel=\"nofollow\">Raymond Brown&#x2019;s introduction</a> I remember as being good too, but I spent less time with it than with Ehrman. As I recall, Brown was really big on John &#x2013; John usually gets less attention than the synoptics. </p>\n<p>Also, Ehrman is an evangelical Protestant turned agnostic, whereas Brown was a Catholic. So they&#x2019;re going to have somewhat different approaches. </p>\n<p>A good bible is a must. NRSV is pretty standard for scholarship these days. One really cool thing I have is the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Jewish-Annotated-New-Testament/dp/0195297709\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jewish Annotated New Testament</a>, which is a footnoted NRSV New Testament with essays and such by Jewish scholars. Really helps put things in context. </p>\n<p>If you don&#x2019;t have any Greek, and even if you do, a gospel synopsis is helpful  in letting you compare the four gospels, and compare the Greek to the English. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Synopsis-Four-Gospels-Quattuor-Evangeliorum/dp/3438054051\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Aland one</a> is kind of the gold standard. I actually preferred <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Parallel-Gospels-Synopsis-Christian-Writing/dp/0199739412/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1463665099&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=zeba+crook\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Zeba Crook one</a> which is a literal word-for-word translation with a glossary. It is better for letting you compare the Greek to the English and see where translations flatten things out and so forth. If you really want to get hardcore, a Greek lexicon can help &#x2013; I remember liking <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Analytical-Lexicon-Greek-New-Testament/dp/0310542103/ref=sr_1_14?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1463665450&amp;sr=1-14&amp;keywords=mounce\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mounce&#x2019;s analytical lexicon</a> but then again I was taking Greek, so it might be a bit much. </p>\n<p>Finally, if you&#x2019;re doing historical-critical studies, the parables probably interest you. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Stories-Intent-Comprehensive-Guide-Parables/dp/0802842410/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1463665816&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=klyne+snodgrass\" rel=\"nofollow\">This</a> was one of the texts for a course I took on the parables, and I remember it being really good. It gives a good overview of religious and scholarly interpretation of the parables.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T16:06:40.544Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T16:06:41.518Z","PageId":209}}],"mentionCount":1},{"id":21,"title":"Slavery by Another Name: The Re-Enslavement of Black Americans from the Civil War to World War II","author":"Douglas A.

What happened was that, at college, he let a drunk woman sleep it off at his place. She wakes up with no memories in the home of a man who isn&#x2019;t her type, and accuses him of rape. She&#x2019;s believed.</p>\n<p>I don&#x2019;t remember the details of the consequences for him, but they were serious&#x2013; loss of scholarship? Thrown out of university, I&#x2019;m pretty sure.

And if it were bad, why would people do it?</p>\n<p>People don&#x2019;t act under capitalism to make the most money possible. They act to pursue their own self-interest. It does not follow from the fact that it is <i>allowed</i> to commercialize everything, that everything <i>will be</i> commercialized.</p>\n<p>Like, okay, suppose I can prove that marrying one woman will cause me to have more money than marrying another woman. Why is that the determining factor? If I would be miserable with one woman but have more money, or be happy with another and less money, I&#x2019;ll take the second. All you can show is that <i>all else equal</i> I will prefer the woman with more money. But I don&#x2019;t see why that it is bad. It makes sense. It&#x2019;s good.</p>\n<p>It only follows from unrestricted capitalism that people will <i>only</i> pursue money if selection pressures are extreme enough to exclude everything else. That is, if anything else but making the most money possible led to death. But not only is that <i>not</i> the case, it is the opposite of the case. Capitalism has always acted to <i>lower</i> the strength of selection pressures by increasing the wealth of society. It is not the system of &#x201C;survival of the fittest&#x201D;; it is the system which enables the unfit to survive longer and in better condition than ever.

Such, then, are the first principles of the Gospel: that there is one God, the Maker of this universe; He who was also announced by the prophets, and who by Moses set forth the dispensation of the law,&#x2014; [principles] which proclaim the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and ignore any other God or Father except Him. So firm is the ground upon which these Gospels rest, that the very heretics themselves bear witness to them, and, starting from these [documents], each one of them endeavours to establish his own peculiar doctrine. For the Ebionites, who use Matthew&#x2019;s Gospel only, are confuted out of this very same, making false suppositions with regard to the Lord. But Marcion, mutilating that according to Luke, is proved to be a blasphemer of the only existing God, from those [passages] which he still retains. Those, again, who separate Jesus from Christ, alleging that Christ remained impassible, but that it was Jesus who suffered, preferring the Gospel by Mark, if they read it with a love of truth, may have their errors rectified. Those, moreover, who follow Valentinus, making copious use of that according to John, to illustrate their conjunctions, shall be proved to be totally in error by means of this very Gospel, as I have shown in the first book. Since, then, our opponents do bear testimony to us, and make use of these [documents], our proof derived from them is firm and true.\n</p></blockquote>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T16:29:31.198Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T16:29:31.369Z","PageId":531}}],"mentionCount":1},{"id":266,"title":"Outwitting History: The Amazing Adventures of a Man Who Rescued a Million Yiddish Books","author":"Aaron Lansky","amazonLink":"1565125134","amazonLinkImage":null,"createdAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.633Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.633Z","Mentions":[{"id":228,"mentionDate":"1407922620000","createdAt":"2017-05-06T18:19:09.435Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T18:19:09.435Z","BookId":266,"CommentId":296093,"Comment":{"id":296093,"commentUrl":"http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/12/does-race-exist-does-culture/","commentId":"comment-133769","commentTimestamp":"1407922620000","commentAuthor":"<a href=\"http://www.nancybuttons.com\" rel=\"external nofollow\" class=\"url\">Nancy Lebovitz</a>","commentHtml":"<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Outwitting-History-Amazing-Adventures-Rescued/dp/1565125134\" rel=\"nofollow\">Quite a lot was written in Yiddish</a>, though this didn&#x2019;t keep the language from being at risk.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T16:28:59.737Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T16:29:00.012Z","PageId":513}}],"mentionCount":1},{"id":276,"title":"Intermediate Microeconomics: A Modern Approach","author":"Hal R.

I have a lot of faith in human ingenuity, and mostly suspect that efforts like MIRI will in fact see us through. I argue with posts like yours because I do believe these efforts are important, and have trouble understanding why there is such vehement opposition. (Not yours; it was pretty mild.)</p>\n<p>An AI has several advantages over a puling infant. First, its actual day-to-day needs are small. Second, if those needs are met, it has no significant lifespan limitations, so it can be patient. Third, it may be capable of more focused behavior: a human&#x2019;s ability to take over the world is hampered by a huge array of evolved sub-conscious and conflicting goals, and arguably humans don&#x2019;t have <i>any</i> &#x201C;terminal goals&#x201D;. Fourth, we have presumably created the human-level AI for <i>some</i> purpose, so we&#x2019;ll probably give it access to <i>some</i> resources from the get-go; the purpose will probably not be a secret from the AI itself, so coming up with an argument for more resources &#x2014; even if that&#x2019;s just the ability to run a copy or ten in parallel &#x2014; shouldn&#x2019;t be hard for it to come up with.</p>\n<p>I recommend J.

Hall argues (indirectly) that Bostrom is wrong, largely (I think) because he doesn&#x2019;t find the &#x201C;intelligence overhang&#x201D; step plausible &#x2014; he imagines that the road from subhuman AI to human to superhuman will happen slowly enough that all AIs will find themselves subject to the same kind of market forces and norms that modulate our own behavior. So even superhuman AIs will have to accommodate other superhuman AIs, and the framework in which they will do so is the one we already have.</p>\n<p>I don&#x2019;t find it convincing enough to make me disregard Bostrom, and I still donate to MIRI, but it&#x2019;s an interesting perspective. And unlike Bostrom, Hall has actually worked on AI technology &#x2014; though I can&#x2019;t say whether that gives him a clearer eye or just means he&#x2019;s blinkered by the past. Hall&#x2019;s book wanders around a bit, but the route is scenic.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T15:57:27.786Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T15:57:27.926Z","PageId":126}}],"mentionCount":1},{"id":22,"title":"Annals of the Caliphs' Kitchens","author":"Nawal Nasrallah","amazonLink":"9004188118","amazonLinkImage":null,"createdAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.596Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.596Z","Mentions":[{"id":240,"mentionDate":"1463384460000","createdAt":"2017-05-06T18:22:20.991Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T18:22:20.991Z","BookId":22,"CommentId":130414,"Comment":{"id":130414,"commentUrl":"http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/05/15/open-thread-49-5/","commentId":"comment-358379","commentTimestamp":"1463384460000","commentAuthor":"<a href=\"http://www.daviddfriedman.com\" rel=\"external nofollow\" class=\"url\">David Friedman</a>","commentHtml":"<p>The tenth century <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Annals-Caliphs-Kitchens-Nawal-Nasrallah/dp/9004188118/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1463384420&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=al-warraq\" rel=\"nofollow\">cookbook</a>.</p>\n<p>My and my wife&#x2019;s self-published <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Milk-Almond-Stuff-Armor-Turnip/dp/1460924983/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1463384478&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=How+to+milk+an+almond\" rel=\"nofollow\">cookbook</a>, which includes some recipes from that one.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T16:06:51.740Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T16:06:52.773Z","PageId":210}}],"mentionCount":1},{"id":327,"title":"Salamander","author":"David D.

No one knows everything about the subject with certainty, unless they came here in a time machine from 2000 years ago.  I guess people like books that mesh well with their own religion or ideology.

I love your blog, it&#x2019;s awesome.  I just had my heart broken a little though.  This is why I&#x2019;m a physicist.  Still hard as hell and not as clear as many people think, but easier than fields involving biological organisms to get some level of confidence in your results.  As long as you actually care about reality.  Some physicists are just mathematicians, ie string theorists.</p>\n<p>Did you ever read the golem?  We read it in a philo of science course i took in the education department.

It focusses a bit too much on the uncertainty side, but, i think too many people have gone from faith in an invisible sky god to faith in &#x201C;Science&#x201D;.  I have a post on my blog with an essay i wrote for fun in grad school comparing incentives in science vs incentives in free market capitalism.  I always found faith in the invisible hand of free market capitalism to cure all human ills to be a bit too much like faith in the invisible sky god, and faith in &#x201C;science&#x201D; is right up there.  I have faith that, in the long run, science will probably get closer to reflecting how the universe actually works, but not in any particular current paradigm.  Skepticism is a virtue in science.  Except in climate change, which i consider more like a religion, which i also have post on.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T16:30:55.204Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T16:30:55.460Z","PageId":583}}],"mentionCount":1},{"id":403,"title":"Dream Tending: Awakening to the Healing Power of Dreams","author":"Stephen Aizenstat PhD","amazonLink":"1935528114","amazonLinkImage":null,"createdAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.649Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.649Z","Mentions":[{"id":170,"mentionDate":"1471198980000","createdAt":"2017-05-06T18:12:48.305Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T18:12:48.305Z","BookId":403,"CommentId":96447,"Comment":{"id":96447,"commentUrl":"http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/08/11/book-review-pihkal/","commentId":"comment-397298","commentTimestamp":"1471198980000","commentAuthor":"Jill","commentHtml":"<p>The best book on dream analysis is 32 years old, and has never been surpassed:</p>\n<p>Dream Work: Techniques for Discovering the Creative Power in Dreams Paperback &#x2013; January 1, 1983<br>\nby Jeremy Taylor </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dream-Work-Techniques-Discovering-Creative/dp/0809125250/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1471198707&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=Dream+Work\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.amazon.com/Dream-Work-Techniques-Discovering-Creative/dp/0809125250/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1471198707&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=Dream+Work</a>  </p>\n<p>My 2nd favorite book came out 4 ago:</p>\n<p>Dream Tending: Awakening to the Healing Power of Dreams Paperback &#x2013; June 23, 2011<br>\nby Stephen Aizenstat Ph.D<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dream-Tending-Awakening-Healing-Dreams/dp/1935528114/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1471198801&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Dream+Tending\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.amazon.com/Dream-Tending-Awakening-Healing-Dreams/dp/1935528114/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1471198801&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Dream+Tending</a></p>\n<p>Many therapists conduct dream work groups and/or do dream analysis in therapy, though they may not always use what seem clearly to me to be the best methods available.

A more involved friend assures me this is an appropriate time and place to plug a project of mine, but I apologize if this a little more self-interested than is considered cool around here.</p>\n<p>Some associates of mine recently put a lot of effort into e-publishing a novel that I wrote as a younger man.  It kind of tests the boundaries of what you can call a novel, but, in any case, it&#x2019;s a book-length fictional narrative.  Years ago, Andrew Hussie (now of MSPaintAdventures fame, then about to be of Problem Sleuth fame) did some illustrations for the book.  The best description/explanation of the book I can give you is an excerpt from an email I sent to Hussie in the course of planning the illustrations.

Honestly, most of the holes in the story flat-out don&#x2019;t matter; if you can keep track of &#x201C;this guy wants to kill that guy, and this guy owes this woman something for something, and this woman has a mysterious past,&#x201D; you should be able to make it through a single reading without too much pain.  (I don&#x2019;t know what &#x201C;should&#x201D; means in that context.)  There are connections to draw down the line, after you&#x2019;ve read it all, if you care enough to do so, but that&#x2019;s putting the manure before the horse.</p>\n<p>The phony confusion is why the fuck the story&#x2019;s written the way it is.  By which I mean, out of chronological order, and with huge gaps between events.  I don&#x2019;t know whether that&#x2019;s high concept or what the hell.  The real deal is that there have been a number of narratives I&#x2019;ve encountered in a disorganized way, and loved, only to be disappointed when I found the correct order and the whole story. </p>\n<p>One, maybe the first, was Liquid Television on MTV, especially the old Aeon Flux shorts.  My brother and I would watch the show whenever we could catch it on, but we never seemed to know when it was on.  So, we ended up seeing all these serial cartoons out of order, and trying to figure out what was going on.  With Aeon Flux, it was pretty difficult, because there wasn&#x2019;t much explanation of what was going on, except that this woman wanted to kill this guy, and there was some disease killing people, and the woman may have been dreaming the entire thing.  My brother and I thought we had it all figured out, until we saw an episode that played the entire Aeon Flux serial in order, and we realized we weren&#x2019;t even close.  Oh well.</p>\n<p>It happened to me repeatedly with big, expansive, sci-fi/fantasy universes that seem impossibly complicated to an outsider.  I started reading X-Men comics in the middle of The X-cutioner&#x2019;s Song, some byzantine four-title crossover that barely makes sense to anybody.  What&#x2019;s interesting about that story arc is that it&#x2019;s all about a villain whose motives nobody understands, but who is slowly revealed to be seeking vengeance for some past wrong that seems more imagined than real.  That meant that I, some kid who just knows what powers these people have and what color underwear they display, was largely in the same boat as some of the characters.  There was so much information out there that no matter how deep I dug into the mythology, my understanding was becoming richer and my appreciation greater.  It was years before I realized that X-Men comics were stupid as hell.</p>\n<p>Then, the same thing happened to me with Dragon Ball Z, and probably something else at some time, but I think you get my point.  I was finding things that were mysterious and intriguing foe the newcomer, but stupid as hell to the expert.  Well, except Aeon Flux.  I still like that stuff.</p>\n<p>Shortly before I started writing Chilling Like Didymus, which was originally intended to be a self-contained detective novel, I watched Mulholland Drive, and sort of fell in love with the movie.  I watched it about a half a million times, and thought I had figured some stuff out, but it was still rather baffling.  Then I started reading stuff online, and the common consensus was that the first 2/3 of the movie was a dream.  I thought that was a bullshit solution, but upon further inspection, I realized that was almost certainly correct.  I looked hard for a way that might not be the solution, but I could come up with nothing else that wasn&#x2019;t equally dumb.</p>\n<p>I also read the book Who Censored Roger Rabbit? around that time.  (The movie Who Framed Roger Rabbit? was based off that book, in the sense that they both featured characters named &#x201C;Roger Rabbit.&#x201D;)  I liked the book a lot, and it was probably the first mystery novel I&#x2019;d ever read.  The ending reveal was absolutely ludicrous, in a way that didn&#x2019;t really impede appreciation of the story.  I&#x2019;ve since read most of the Sherlock Holmes stuff, The Maltese Falcon, Edgar Allen Poe&#x2019;s detective stuff&#x2013;it&#x2019;s all well and good, but the solutions generally aren&#x2019;t any less ridiculous than the twist in Roger Rabbit&#x2019;s book.  (Eddie Valiant boxes a genie!  NO SHIT.)</p>\n<p>So, I set out to write this detective story, with this totally batshit twist to it that I took from an interview Robert Anton Wilson gave to some weird Canadian radio personality named Nardwaar.  Wilson told this stupid joke about how Timothy Leary&#x2019;s ashes had been condensed into some kind of super drug.  I quickly realized that didn&#x2019;t really give me the basis for any sort of mystery, so I started dumping in other shit from the interview: Hitler&#x2019;s cock&#x2019;s whereabouts, secret societies, sex and magic and bullshit.  At this point, I no longer remember what the original plot was, or how I intended to wrap up the story.</p>\n<p>I had it all planned out, though, and I started writing a bunch of the scenes.  I didn&#x2019;t write in chronological order, though, because I&#x2019;d get so excited about future scenes that I&#x2019;d just jump ahead to writing them.  So, eventually, I had all these disconnected scenes, and a general plan, and I suddenly realized that some of my scenes were narrated in first person, and some were in third.  I honestly have no idea how I could have written several scenes without considering that problem, especially since John Tanis&#x2019;s voice is completely different from the matter-of-fact proclamations of the third-person narrator.  Maybe I knew it all along and didn&#x2019;t care.  I don&#x2019;t remember.</p>\n<p>So, I had all these important scenes written out, all in the same document, but all disconnected.  And it hit me that all those boring connecting scenes really weren&#x2019;t all that important, that with the information in there everyone could tell what was going on, and really, the only thing I&#x2019;d be doing by telling the whole story is dragging it out too fucking long.</p>\n<p>Then I changed some stuff so it made less sense, and put the sections in the wrong order.</p>\n<p>Now, I realized I was recreating the sort of confusion I appreciated from the earlier works I mentioned.  Except, here, the confusion would be perpetual.  I devised several solutions to the mystery of Danielle&#x2019;s death, and made sure to keep the story logically consistent with all of them.  Literarily, not all solutions are equal, and one solution is certainly hinted at more than others.  But, the point was to ensure that no one could ever discover, &#x201C;Oh, the genie did it,&#x201D; and feel secure in that solution.</p>\n<p>Then, I got the bright idea to expand the story.  I changed the ending again (I don&#x2019;t remember what it used to be), and tried to not do the same thing three times, but probably did.</p>\n<p>The thing is, The Two Travelers was not intended to be chronologically confusing.  Actually, once you realize that it&#x2019;s telling three separate stories, you can easily determine that each story is being told in chronological order; the chronological confusion comes from the intersection of the three stories.</p>\n<p>I long regretted that I made The Two Travelers so straightforward.  Maybe that was not a legitimate preoccupation.</p>\n<p>The thing is, while I always tried to have some plausible explanation for the nitty-gritty of the story, I just don&#x2019;t think it matters enough to explain in the book.  Why the fuck would William State arrange for his death to trigger a self-destruct sequence?  That&#x2019;s just idiotic.  And why the hell does Rock Mahon need to kill everybody who spoke the John Tanis?  Doesn&#x2019;t that raise more suspicion?</p>\n<p>And that&#x2019;s sort of where the fairy tale business comes in.  These things are based on other stories.  They&#x2019;re not all fairy tales, but they&#x2019;re all those sorts of stories.  And because I&#x2019;m forcing these characters into these roles, to those who would ask, &#x201C;Why the hell would this happen?&#x201D;, I can only offer, &#x201C;But it did happen.&#x201D;  That may not be a particularly satisfying answer.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Eve&#x2019;s Various Children&#x201D; is probably the best example of this type of horseshit. Even within the context of this book, it makes no sense.  A professional hitman picks up a bunch of unknown, loitering weirdos to a professor&#x2019;s house, where they all proceed to make themselves at home, and then gang up to harass and murder the professor.  For good measure, the professor is referred to as both male and female.</p>\n<p>Well, Jesus, how do you explain that?  There&#x2019;s a Grimm Fairy Tale, &#x201C;Mister Korbes,&#x201D;  in which a bunch of animals and inanimate objects meet up and travel to visit Mister Korbes.  He&#x2019;s not home when they arrive, so they situate themselves in the joint and get comfortable.  Mister Korbes finally arrives, and they kill him.  The only hint of an explanation?  &#x201C;What a bad man he must have been!&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Jesus, how do you explain that?</p>\n<p>Alright, so there&#x2019;s some nonsensical fairy tale, and I decide to base part of the story on it.  Does that really justify my story making no sense?  I guess I just don&#x2019;t see it as important.  Yeah, it&#x2019;s utterly ridiculous.  You could probably assume, even within the context of the story, that it couldn&#x2019;t really happen as it was described; that shouldn&#x2019;t affect the rest of the story.  Rock Mahon killed Dr. Yice&#x2013;does it matter whether he did it with a gun or a Communist?</p>\n<p>Honestly, that part&#x2019;s so far gone that even I don&#x2019;t really consider it part of the story.  But it does serve as fair warning, I think, for how crazy this shit&#x2019;s about to get.  Self-destruct sequence?  Ok, I guess.  &#x201C;Kill everybody&#x201D;?  Meh, why not.</p>\n<p>And that third section, well, it seems pretty straight-forward to me too, but I&#x2019;m sure I&#x2019;m wrong about that.</p>\n<p>I suppose the summary of all that is that I intended to recreate an aesthetic effect that I have failed utterly to recreate in another human being.  Actually, it worked with one guy, but heI&#x2019;m&#x2019;s kind of a weirdo.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T16:01:57.797Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T16:01:59.173Z","PageId":169}}],"mentionCount":1},{"id":385,"title":"America's Premier Gunmakers","author":"K.D.

Perhaps some basic income supporters don&#x2019;t mind this as they see it as a form of charity.</p>\n<p>Also, I pointed out that one requirement to join a proposed basic income plan might be to have a minimum reputation score, which could be a credit score, Uber rating, or some other yet to exist rating that measures the likeliness of contributing versus taking.    </p>\n<blockquote><p>And if the plan is for people to commit for their entire (working) lives, who is going to enforce that? </p></blockquote>\n<p>If lifelong enforcement is an insurmountable problem, then lifelong basic income plans won&#x2019;t exist.  Enforcement mechanisms and costs would need to be accounted for in the proposed basic income plan.</p>\n<p>Note that Mutual Aid Societies <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Mutual-Aid-Welfare-State-Fraternal/dp/0807848417\" rel=\"nofollow\">did in fact exist</a>, so there exists some combination of factors that allows voluntary organization to exist as some form of an income support program.  Charity does exist today as well, so many people have a propensity to be willing to commit income without expected monetary returns.</p>\n<p>Perhaps no basic income plans would get voluntary buy-in or be sustainable.  It&#x2019;d be good to know that, and perhaps other types of smart contract voluntary orgs would be more prevalent, like say a group that commits to unemployment benefits, or life insurance, or health insurance, or disability insurance.  I&#x2019;m interested in what the marketplace of ideas can produce.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T16:05:29.309Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T16:05:30.746Z","PageId":199}}],"mentionCount":1},{"id":394,"title":"The Deluge: The Great War, America and the Remaking of the Global Order, 1916-1931","author":"Adam Tooze","amazonLink":"0143127977","amazonLinkImage":null,"createdAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.648Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.648Z","Mentions":[{"id":61,"mentionDate":"1482086880000","createdAt":"2017-05-06T18:08:25.900Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T18:08:25.900Z","BookId":394,"CommentId":49282,"Comment":{"id":49282,"commentUrl":"http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/12/17/ot65-the-early-thread-gets-the-worm/","commentId":"comment-445371","commentTimestamp":"1482086880000","commentAuthor":"cassander","commentHtml":"<p>Deluge by Adam Tooze.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Deluge-America-Remaking-Global-1916-1931/dp/0143127977\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.amazon.com/Deluge-America-Remaking-Global-1916-1931/dp/0143127977</a></p>\n<p>Tooze wrote what I regard as the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Wages-Destruction-Making-Breaking-Economy/dp/0143113208/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_2?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=0143113208&amp;pd_rd_r=BBAHCDSPZEW8BH6Z7J85&amp;pd_rd_w=dEZw7&amp;pd_rd_wg=4B76J&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=BBAHCDSPZEW8BH6Z7J85\" rel=\"nofollow\">single best book</a> on WW2 a few years ago (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Shattered-Sword-Jonathan-Parshall-Hardcover/dp/B00849DHJK/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482086301&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=shattered+sword\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> is the only competition), and while Deluge is not quite as good, it&#x2019;s an amazing look at the the economics of WW1. </p>\n<p>Also excellent is <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1498194.Fire_In_The_Sky\" rel=\"nofollow\">fire in the sky</a> that really gets into the how and why of history, not just the what.</p>\n<p>Geoffrey Parker&#x2019;s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Army-Flanders-Spanish-Road-1567-1659/dp/0521543924\" rel=\"nofollow\">The army of Flanders</a>.

This is documented in an excellent work, <i><a href=\"http://smile.amazon.com/Island-at-Center-World-ebook/dp/B000FCK2Z6/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1462196643&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=island+in+the+middle+of+the+world\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Island at the Center of the World</a></i> by Russell Shorto, who argues that the uniquely American character of deal-making and &#x201C;everything&#x2019;s negotiable&#x201D; comes to us from the Dutch. He also argues&#x2013;with considerable merit in my view&#x2013;that the Dutch also brought many cultural influences which led to the strongly democratic tendencies we see in America: unlike, say, the Quakers, who (as you and Fischer describe them above) paid a great deal of lip service to the concept of equality, but who kicked the Borderers out of town when they got too rowdy, the Dutch of New Amsterdam (their name for present-day New York) actually practiced it: the New Amsterdam of its hey day was a city of whites, blacks, Indians, and every possible combination of the above&#x2013;and all competing&#x2013;squabbling, arguing, fighting&#x2013;as equals in a marketplace where all were welcome so long as they had something to offer.</p>\n<p>A few other comments, in no particular order:</p>\n<p>1. The Democratic-Republicans had NOTHING to do with the modern-day Republicans. Or everything, but then also with the modern-day Democrats. They were, for a time&#x2013;basically from the collapse of the Federalist Party in the early 1800s to the breakdown of the Democratic-Republicans into Whigs and Democrats in the 1820s, the so-called &#x201C;Era of Good Feelings&#x201D;&#x2013;the ONLY political party extant in the United States, and as such, you can argue they were the progenitors of all the rest. But the reality is that the original Republican Party of the 1850s and 1860s picked up most of the pieces of the old Whig Party and some of the Northern bits of the Democratic Party to assemble into a coalition that was centered around&#x2013;as their slogans would have it&#x2013;&#x201C;Free Soil and Free Men&#x201D;, in contradistinction to the Democratic Party, which was increasingly defined by its unwavering commitment to maintaining the &#x201C;Peculiar Institution&#x201D; as slavery was often called (note for moderns: &#x201C;peculiar&#x201D; in that era meant &#x201C;specific to&#x201D; rather than &#x201C;odd&#x201D; as we might nowadays think).</p>\n<p>2. Trying to connect the underlying views of the early settlers to modern PARTISAN divisions is hopelessly wrong: rather, you need to look past the party labels and focus on the ideological and philosophical differences. If you look at county-by-county maps of today&#x2019;s partisan alignments you will find they are almost exactly the negative image of the partisan alignments of a century ago, when the South and West were largely DEMOCRATIC areas (except for the West Coast, where the coastal areas were predominantly Republican) and New England, the Mid-Atlantic region and the Midwest were largely REPUBLICAN. But if you look past the party labels you can discern some interesting connections.</p>\n<p>3. The Michigan experience you reference is far from unique. In his important work, <i><a href=\"http://smile.amazon.com/Emerging-Republican-Majority-American-Politics-ebook/dp/B00M5JXUHO/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1462198047&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=emerging+republican+majority\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Emerging Republican Majority</a></i>, Kevin Phillips shows that migration patterns in the United States&#x2013;with one important exception&#x2013;were from East to West <b>along essentially the same lines of latitude</b>. So northwestern areas like Michigan, Minnesota, Washington and Oregon tended to be settled by people from New England (Portland, Oregon was named after Portland, Maine, and could as easily have been named for Boston, Mass) and the mid-Atlantic&#x2013;i.e. Puritans and Quakers&#x2013;whereas more southwestern areas&#x2013;Arizona, New Mexico, and southern California&#x2013;tended to be settled by Southerners&#x2013;Cavaliers and Borderers. The notable exception? The Great Migrations of blacks, which as one might guess went from South to North: we think of blacks as being largely an urban people, but in reality, until the 1920s, most blacks lived in the rural South (gee, I wonder why?).</p>\n<p>4. Northern New England was both heavily Republican and conservative until the last half-century, when the native population was numerically overwhelmed by the in-migration of Bostonians (to southern New Hampshire) and New Yorkers and others (to Vermont and Maine). As these were smaller states to begin with, much of the remaining &#x201C;footprint&#x201D; of the original settlers is now confined to the relatively inaccessible and rural parts of these states. You also see this happening&#x2013;albeit to a lesser degree&#x2013;in some of the Mountain states, e.g. Arizona (huge influx of retirees), New Mexico (huge influx of &#x201C;alternate&#x201D; cultist types) and Colorado (huge influx of urbanites of all sorts). Notice however that Utah, Idaho and Wyoming seem to have been much less susceptible, possibly on account of the large Mormon footprint in those states.</p>\n<p>I could add a few other things but those are the big ones. I could also give you some suggestions as to how to disentangle things, but that&#x2019;s an entirely new topic, so I&#x2019;ll let it go! &#x1F642;</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T16:07:45.119Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T16:07:46.927Z","PageId":219}}],"mentionCount":1},{"id":191,"title":"Flesh and Machines: How Robots Will Change Us","author":"Rodney Brooks","amazonLink":"B000RH0DZI","amazonLinkImage":null,"createdAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.628Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-05T22:39:01.628Z","Mentions":[{"id":320,"mentionDate":"1488930780000","createdAt":"2017-05-06T18:55:32.707Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T18:55:32.707Z","BookId":191,"CommentId":21739,"Comment":{"id":21739,"commentUrl":"http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/06/book-review-behavior-the-control-of-perception/","commentId":"comment-474125","commentTimestamp":"1488930780000","commentAuthor":"bara","commentHtml":"<p>A few comments:<br>\n&#x2013; It&#x2019;s obvious (and falsifiable) that the theory works for the lower levels, not so much for the higher ones.

He uses a couple analogies of other prospective consent. The first is from classical literature &#x2013; Ulysses tied to the mast. He prospectively ceded his negative bodily autonomy, that is, he gave others the right to decide at a later date what he could <i>not</i> do. Normally, tying someone up like that and refusing to let them go might be some form of kidnapping, but his prospective consent could provide a defense for such a charge.</p>\n<p>The second example I recall him using was skydiving. Suppose a person had gone up in an airplane a few times, each time chickening out at the moment of the jump, and returning to the ground inside the plane. Finally, she tells the instructor, &#x201C;No matter what I say when I&#x2019;m up there, I want you to throw me out of the plane.&#x201D; Normally, throwing someone out of plane would be some form of assault, but we are likely to accept her prospective consent, ceding her positive autonomy to perform the jump and providing a defense to such a charge for the instructor.</p>\n<p>He gave a few factors from these examples (and others that I don&#x2019;t recall offhand) that would make us more/less likely to accept prospective consent, but I see very little reason to draw a bright line around the category of sexual activities in order to make it uniquely immune. The easier case is prospective consent to cede negative sexual autonomy &#x2013; &#x201C;You&#x2019;re my friends, girls.

Viscerally and profanely.</p>\n<p>Plus, I think that rejecting voices/comments on the grounds of anything other than rationality is counter to the proposed purpose of the blog/community.  I mean, seriously, we&#x2019;re trying to make a better world, but only if the ideas that are accepted as &#x201C;better&#x201D; come from left-wingers?  </p>\n<p>In the spirit of not just shooting down what I think are terrible, horrible, counter productive ideas, but also offering improvements, I&#x2019;d like to steal from a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Turn-Ship-Around-Turning-Followers/dp/1591846404\" rel=\"nofollow\">leadership-management book</a> I was reading, and propose a different solution: </p>\n<p>Designated dissenters/defectors.</p>\n<p>When a left-leaning person makes a post they think is going to get a pile-on, or when a pile-on happens, they can tag a couple three &#x2018;known red tribers&#x2019; to post <i>supporting the left-leaning person</i>.  The &#x2018;defectors&#x2019; would then make arguments from the left, to the best of their ability.</p>\n<p>In my head, this advantages the designated defectors, because they get (more) practice speaking from the opposition.  It helps the left leaners, because they&#x2019;re not out there all alone, and they even have support from &#x2018;the enemy&#x2019;. </p>\n<p>One objection might be that the designated defectors might feel like they were being forced to &#x201C;lie&#x201D;, but I feel that an upfront statement of defection, plus the attitude of &#x201C;this is a mental exercise&#x201D; would avoid that.</p>\n<p>I think that someone alluded to this earlier, but speaking as a redtribe sort who has been exposed to way too many of the wrong sort of ctrl-L, I have a really negative reaction to the &#x201C;shut up, we don&#x2019;t want to hear you&#x201D; kind of censorship.

At the most general, Darwin&#x2019;s &#x201C;theory&#x201D; was more of an observation. Scott is doing something similar by pointing out that if we trace the history of the Major World Religions, it appears they were once fully-fledged cultures.  The theory part will come into play when we make more specific claims about the actual history of various religions&#x2019; evolutions and the mechanisms by which cultural drift occurs. </p>\n<p>E.g.

He had this theory that Moses was actually a sympathetic Egyptian Noble and that his Jewish Birth was a convenient fiction. He also had this theory that Judaism came into contact with (and was strongly influenced by) Zoroastrianism sometime between the Egyptian Exodus and the Fall of Jericho, and that this is from where Judaism&#x2019;s &#x201C;Light vs Darkness&#x201D; meme originates.

Or is it simply not denying high-school chemistry relating to the emissions spectrum of CO2, which I&#x2019;d say is a great deal more certain than 97%?  My impression is that the consensus on AGW is that<br>\na) the world is getting warmer, largely or entirely due to CO2 emissions.<br>\nb) we can make models to outline a range of effect sizes<br>\nc) the models are known to be highly unreliable, have huge error bars, and even the high-end estimates give effect sizes small enough that given normal rates of time discounting it wouldn&#x2019;t be worth paying much now to correct the problem, but given how unreliable the models are, their high-end estimates aren&#x2019;t the real high-end anyway<br>\nd) empirically, the glaciers seem to be melting faster than the high-end estimates from the models predict, but no-one has a good explanation for what&#x2019;s happening there<br>\ne) there&#x2019;s little philosophical consensus in favor of time discounting<br>\nf) there are lots of non-AGW reasons for doing many of the things that are proposed as solutions to AGW by mainstream authorities.

Sometimes people not in your field can give useful feedback too.  Do you ever mention your questions of interest in your field here on SSC?  Of course, feedback wouldn&#x2019;t be as focused within your field or as detailed as you&#x2019;d get from people in your field, but still it might be worthwhile.</p>\n<p>Another thing that crosses my mind is that you might want to pay an editor, who edits intellectual books in various areas, for some feedback.</p>\n<p>It sounds like it does work to some degree when the 2nd-most prestigious journal gets your heavily edited and polished article which has received a ton of useful critique from the reviewers of the 1st-most prestigious journal which rejected it.  You could also try reversing that process.  Why not submit to the 2nd-most prestigious journal first, at least on occasion, and thus shoot for ultimate publication in the 1st most prestigious journal? </p>\n<p>One thing I would do&#x2013; but I&#x2019;m an extrovert and this may not be easy for some people&#x2013; would be to go to academic conferences in my field and look for people who seem altruistic enough that they might be willing to give feedback to a colleague.  Or else just cooperative enough that they may be willing to do a trade.  And also sharp enough in their knowledge of the field that their feedback would be worthwhile.  I&#x2019;d get phone numbers and/or emails of such people.  Then I&#x2019;d see if I could trade a few things back and forth with them by email, giving each other feedback, and if it was useful.  If you start a blog, you can email the web site of your blog out to those who are interested and whom you trust. </p>\n<p>This sort of thing works for me for various purposes.  I have a Ph.D. and am a writer and a personal growth aficionado.  I&#x2019;ve been trading personal growth exercises by phone for over a year now with someone with a similar degree of sophistication to me, in the areas of interest to me.

Those are also interesting data points.  Here&#x2019;s a simple model that seems to explain a lot of data: (1) Social justice people cause drama wherever they go.  (2) Male-dominated groups are highly fertile ground for social justice people.  (Probably because they tend to be filled with undersocialized nerds who believe that female SJW entryists to their group represent the perspective of your average woman.  Undersocialized nerds then either proceed to become SJWs themselves, because that&#x2019;s apparently the only way women will ever like you, or start hating women, because apparently they&#x2019;re all SJWs.  Either response draws more SJWs: the first obviously creates them, and the second brings them in to respond to the problem of undersocialized nerds hating women.)</p>\n<p>This suggests that male-dominated groups wishing to avoid drama should take a proactive approach to bringing non social justicey women in to their group, or at least getting their members some friendly contact with women on an occasional basis.  Examples: Make your hub a city that has <a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/Date-onomics-Dating-Became-Lopsided-Numbers/dp/076118208X/\" rel=\"nofollow\">excess single women, not excess single men</a>.  (Hint: NOT the Bay Area.)  Dual class in hobbies like ballroom dancing or acting that skew female.  Use strategies that will *actually* work for improving your group&#x2019;s gender ratio instead of providing SJWs a platform for their endless complaining (that often has the effect of driving women away and perpetuating the cycle).</p>\n<p>Problem: Publicly discussing strategies for finding women can create friction if women are already a part of the group.  The more machiavellian women may try to block such efforts in order to preserve their privileged status within the group.  I&#x2019;m not sure how to solve this.</p>\n","createdAt":"2017-05-06T16:00:41.541Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-06T16:00:42.193Z","PageId":156}}],"mentionCount":1}]
